2018-01-04 14:16:33	@ngxbot	Use `curl` for testing. Seriously. Check configs with `nginx -t`, then reload. Browser caching causes phantom issues. Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop. > see also !curl_creed
2018-01-04 14:16:33	tete_	curl works
2018-01-04 14:16:33	monoxane	i dont know if this is nginx or docker related so im just gonna ask in both chans, when reverse proxying from one container to another (in one docker-compose file) using upstream {bla} i get a 502 gateway error, what am i doing wrong?
2018-01-04 14:16:33	@ngxbot	Paste from monoxane: [ https://paste.ngx.cc/6a9e ]
2018-01-04 14:16:33	monoxane	thats my config
2018-01-04 14:16:33	monoxane	cachet is the container name
2018-01-04 14:16:33	vandemar	502 gateway error is not a specific error; you need to check the nginx error log
2018-01-04 14:16:33	monoxane	oh my god im an idiot
2018-01-04 14:16:33	monoxane	i forgot an entire prefix of the container name
2018-01-04 14:16:33	monoxane	ignore me
2018-01-04 14:16:33	iDanoo	haha :D
2018-01-04 14:16:33	Gasher	hello. I get a 502 error on nginx because it looks for fpm of php version 7.1, but I have 7.0 installed on my system instead. how to change the version of php nginx looks for?
2018-01-04 14:16:33	vandemar	nginx doesn't know a thing about php versions.  you told it to connect to the wrong socket.  give it the correct socket.
2018-01-04 14:16:33	Gasher	vandemar, where?
2018-01-04 14:16:33	Gasher	nvm
2018-01-04 14:16:33	Gasher	that's what copy-pasting configs from the internet got me, thanks
2018-01-04 14:16:33	mar77i	hmm. there was that magic header my response could pass back to nginx that would tell nginx to send data from a static file... I'm just unable to google the name of that header
2018-01-04 14:16:33	mar77i	does anyone here remember what it was?
2018-01-04 14:16:33	mar77i	X-Serve-That-Static-File: /static/file ... something?
2018-01-04 14:16:33	benbrown	X-Accel-Redirect?
2018-01-04 14:16:33	mar77i	just this moment I came across it myself. thanks.
2018-01-04 14:16:33	benbrown	heh
2018-01-04 14:16:33	kostyay	hi. when using `proxy_intercept_errors` in conjunction with content_by_lua_block is it possible to access the proxy's response?
2018-01-04 14:16:33	kostyay	my proxies return json errors i would like nginx to format them in pretty way
2018-01-04 14:16:33	kostyay	so far the only way i can think of doing it is with `body_filter_by_lua_block` but that seems inefficient as this block will be called on each request even if successul and i have to add lua logic to decide if its an error or not (correct me if im wrong)
2018-01-04 14:16:33	armage	hello
2018-01-04 14:16:33	TSM	is there a way to have *-ac.domain.com as a server_name? we are unable to get this to work
2018-01-04 14:16:33	Peng_	Literally?
2018-01-04 14:16:33	TSM	we get ' nginx: [emerg] invalid server name or wildcard'
2018-01-04 14:16:33	Peng_	!server_name
2018-01-04 14:16:33	@ngxbot	http://ngx.cc/r/server_name
2018-01-04 14:16:33	Peng_	Regular expressions are supported.
2018-01-04 14:16:33	Peng_	(That's not a regular expression.)
2018-01-04 14:16:33	TSM	what we are trying to work out is why '*-ac.domain.com' is invalid but '*ac.domain.com' is valid, is the hyphen considered a dot border?
2018-01-04 14:16:33	Peng_	I thought both were invalid.
2018-01-04 14:16:33	armage	Is there a way to use URL like https://plop.tld/script.php/foo/bar?a=b with nginx ? My server answers "404 not found" (works if I remove /foo/bar...)
2018-01-04 14:16:33	TSM	why not use rewrite?
2018-01-04 14:16:33	armage	TSM: you mean specific rewrite on script.php(.*) ?
2018-01-04 14:16:33	armage	I hoped that "Location \.php(/|$)" along with fastcgi_split_path_info will be enough, but it is not
2018-01-04 14:16:33	armage	(I'm early beginner with nginx)
2018-01-04 14:16:33	benbrown	that location's not right, you need a ~ to let nginx know it's a regex
2018-01-04 14:16:33	benbrown	e.g. location ~ \.php(/|$) {
2018-01-04 14:16:33	TSM	https://plop.tld/script.php/foo/bar?a=b  to https://plop.tld/script/foo/bar?a=b  would then rewritten internally to push everything after script/ to script.php, I would need to consult with my collegue who has more experience with this.ginx
2018-01-04 14:16:33	TSM	        location ~(cache|imgcache) {             try_files $uri $uri/ /get-image.php$is_args$args;          }
2018-01-04 14:16:33	TSM	eg
2018-01-04 14:16:33	benbrown	I think that's a different use case to what armage is trying to du
2018-01-04 14:16:33	benbrown	*do
2018-01-04 14:16:33	armage	benbrown: right, I forgot the ~ here, but it's on my conf
2018-01-04 14:16:33	nikitasius	helloworld!
2018-01-04 14:16:33	mar77i	ah, I asked earlier about X-Accel-Redirect here. now I'm wondering if I could get nginx to figure out the content type for me as well

2018-01-16 10:17:57	boxes	Hello. When I was researching how a high performance application server should speak to nginx I always came across FastCGI. But I found that since I never saw any examples of app servers using proper event loops. Now I'm seeing comments on stackoverflow that FastCGI is slow?
2018-01-16 10:17:57	boxes	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7616601/nginx-fastcgi-and-open-sockets
2018-01-16 10:17:57	boxes	"You use Nginx and FastCGI to develop a high performance website? Then implement your own HTTP 1.0 protocol. It is much easier to do and will be much faster than using FCGI. Or, you can code your own module for nginx to"..
2018-01-16 10:17:57	boxes	but I found that strange* - (damnit, I missed a word)
2018-01-16 10:17:57	SmokedCheese	http1.0 is very simple and easier to debug
2018-01-16 10:17:57	boxes	SmokedCheese: Is there no *the* way to forward requests to backend servers? I have my suspicions that FastCGI was slow, I asked around, but never had my suspicions confirmed until coming across that stackoverflow link. It's weird how little information there is out there.
2018-01-16 10:17:57	SmokedCheese	what do you mean by 'way to forward requests to backend servers'?
2018-01-16 10:17:57	boxes	have nginx as reverse proxy
2018-01-16 10:17:57	SmokedCheese	proxy_pass is pretty much just forwarding http requests
2018-01-16 10:17:57	chrisml	any idea why SSI includes would show weird characters
2018-01-16 10:17:57	chrisml	but when i go to them individually, the code is fine
2018-01-16 10:17:57	chrisml	the includes are from an external host
2018-01-16 10:17:57	SmokedCheese	maybe wrong encoding?
2018-01-16 10:17:57	benbrown	wrong content-type?
2018-01-16 10:17:57	chrisml	could be gzipped? but they work individually, i.e. when i go to includes/header, etc
2018-01-16 10:17:57	chrisml	yeah, they're gzipped
2018-01-16 10:17:57	chrisml	sudo apt update; sudo apt install -y nginx-extras; add gunzip on to location block, reload nginx, fixed :D

2018-01-16 10:17:57	jaybe	nginx already spawns workers as non root
2018-01-16 10:17:57	jaybe	starting as root allows to write to protected areas such as var log, interaction with logrotated, etc. certs. etc.

2018-01-16 16:09:03	marchelly	Hi, should I follow SEO specialis requests and do such a things like: 1. redirect index.php to / 2. redirect url ending with slash to no-slash url and 3. www to no-www url?

2018-01-16 16:14:32	benbrown	It's a pretty standard practice to do it in nginx. HOWEVER - a lot of js stuff use #/some/path for routing, which the client never sends to nginx, so if it's using that then there's no point doing it in nginx

2018-01-16 22:11:33	@ngxbot	Use `curl` for testing. Seriously. Check configs with `nginx -t`, then reload. Browser caching causes phantom issues. Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.

2018-01-17 10:06:57	vandemar	You're not setting a Host: header; proxy_protocol doesn't exist in http context.  Ideally you should have a location / { } wrapping the proxy_pass but that's not strictly necessary.  You're using $ssl_preread_server_name which doesn't exist in http context either afaik.

I'm presently under the impression that for one to proxy http traffic I must use a http{server{}} block to route to the backend by name and that for https traffic I can use my stream{server{}} to support SNI ?
2018-01-17 10:10:12	vandemar	oh, I thought you meant more like /foo rather than /path/to/htdocroot/foo.  yeah, you probably want log_not_found

I created an additional nginx server that is doing a reverse proxy onto the artifactory reverse proxy. I'm testing pushing images to the registry and it works if I go direc

2018-01-17 23:19:22	APCodes	Fireye_: So the reason that artifactory comes with this built in nginx server is because of how artifactor sets up it's docker registry
2018-01-17 23:19:39	APCodes	the docker registry is located at artifactory.example/com/docker or something like that
2018-01-17 23:19:57	APCodes	the docker client can't push to an address like that
2018-01-17 23:20:33	APCodes	so what this reverse proxy is supposed to do is see an address coming in like docker.artifactory.example.com and rewrite it to artifactory.example.com/docker

2018-01-17 23:24:52	APCodes	there's other requests being fired at the server so I can't really isolate which requests are coming from the custom nginx
2018-01-17 23:25:46	APCodes	that's why I can't debug what's going on
2018-01-17 23:26:46	vandemar	that's what logs or tcpdump filters are fore
2018-01-17 23:27:11	Fireye_	you could use an if in conjunction with a second access_log to dump it out to another log file.  Or grep our just the requests from your host

2018-01-17 23:32:17	APCodes	It's painfully difficult to adjust the nginx configuration for this artifactory nginx because its all controlled by artifactory and if I try and restart nginx the container blows up and restarts with the old config
2018-01-17 23:32:27	Fireye_	those jerks
2018-01-17 23:33:20	APCodes	does `nginx -s reload` stop & restart the process?
2018-01-17 23:33:31	Fireye_	nope, just reloads the configuration
2018-01-17 23:33:39	APCodes	I guess that might work then
2018-01-17 23:33:40	Fireye_	if the configuration is broken, it'll silently fail

2018-01-17 23:34:24	Fireye_	I'm just asking what the HTTP status code was for your request
2018-01-17 23:35:06	APCodes	I don't know because its all in hex
2018-01-17 23:35:17	Fireye_	you said that was only the request portion
2018-01-17 23:35:30	Fireye_	your log format defines   'status = $status '
2018-01-17 23:36:22	Fireye_	ideally you'd trace the request log entry on the external (custom) nginx, artifactory nginx, and artifactory log file
2018-01-17 23:37:29	APCodes	yes but there are lots of other requests hitting the artifactory nginx and I don't know which one is coming in from my external nginx
2018-01-17 23:37:37	APCodes	there's nothing in the log to differentiate it

2018-01-18 06:04:18	MTecknology	there's also something about avoiding `path_info' (or was it `pathinfo'?) and something about `subdir' and also `location'

2018-01-18 06:04:20	@ngxbot	A webapp in a subdirectory (eg //site/app/approute) is tricky if it's not your app, the app expects paths to be /approute instead of /app/approute, and you can't use hardcoding or send custom headers to tell the app its /app path prefix. Solutions: use subdomains instead of subdirs, or keep the request path unchanged for the backend.
2018-01-18 06:04:21	@ngxbot	http://ngx.cc/r/location
2018-01-18 06:04:39	MTecknology	I guess both triggers work ..

2018-01-18 06:08:30	AndyS2_	on the simplest level, if path is routes or v2/* then hit api.php otherwise index.php - that's the ultimate end result

Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.

2018-01-18 12:11:26	@ngxbot	Use `curl` for testing. Seriously. Check configs with `nginx -t`, then reload. Browser caching causes phantom issues. Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.

2018-01-18 13:15:25	tdm4	Hi all.. I'm using the UBuntu PPA stable nginx.. and I've been seeing these warnings all over: [warn] 19919#19919: the "user" directive makes sense only if the master process runs with super-user privileges, ignored in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:1
2018-01-18 13:15:31	tdm4	any ideas how to remove that warning?
2018-01-18 13:16:06	tdm4	nginx 1.21-1-0+xenial0, and line 1 of /etc/nginx/nginx.conf just says: 'user www-data;'  which has worked forever
2018-01-18 13:16:19	tdm4	sorry 1.12.1-0+xenial0
2018-01-18 13:16:25	benbrown	Sounds like you're not staring nginx as root
2018-01-18 13:16:46	benbrown	what does `systemctl status nginx` say?

2018-01-18 13:19:43	tdm4	19904 is master process and it is owned by root
2018-01-18 13:20:10	tdm4	just seems strange.. other Ubuntu 16.04 boxes running the same version og nginx don't have that warning..

2018-01-18 13:20:43	tdm4	nginx -t checks out, no errors

2018-01-18 13:24:33	thresh	as benbrown said :)
2018-01-18 13:25:06	tdm4	just puppet.. but that doesn't do nginx -t as non-root user as far as I know (and it doesn't check in every minute.. more like every half an hour)

2018-01-18 15:44:43	benbrown	Depends on the other locations you need to support
2018-01-18 15:44:58	benbrown	But generally you should set root at the server level
2018-01-18 15:45:41	benbrown	I'm a bit confused by what you've posted though as I would expect the path to be different in the error message, however setting the root properly should still be done

2018-01-18 15:52:20	benbrown	Personally I almost never set a root in a location, it makes more sense to set it at server level, but your use case might be different
2018-01-18 15:53:10	benbrown	also you need to expand on not working, see `doesntwork'

2018-01-18 16:01:34	benbrown	luist: it's safe from the server's pov, it's just static files. Much safer than something with a database behind it.

Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.

2018-01-19 13:17:19	avaika	hi guys. I'm trying to figure out the best way to configure nginx with ssl in aws. the question is more about architecture. my target application is running inside docker. thus from my understanding it's better to run nginx inside docker for me as well. however after a quick search it seems really tricky to get letsencrypt + nginx + docker working smoothly together. any advise on "best practices" from this
2018-01-19 13:17:25	avaika	perspecitve?

2018-01-19 16:56:19	Fireye_	kojiro: resolve, as mentioned in the docs, is a part of the commercial nginx offering.  Why would it be a dns problem, does the IP address of the upstream change frequently?
2018-01-19 16:56:49	kojiro	IDK, I just suspected DNS since the initial request is never making it from the proxy to the upstream.

2018-01-19 17:06:40	kojiro	I think I understand... maybe
2018-01-19 17:07:14	kojiro	The hostname we're using is a CNAME to the public DNS name dynamically allocated to an ec2 instance.
2018-01-19 17:07:25	kojiro	both the nginx proxy and the upstream are ec2 instances in the same vpc
2018-01-19 17:08:05	kojiro	my new hypothesis is that public DNS name resolves at first to a public IP address, and then, moments later, to an internal one.
2018-01-19 17:08:26	vandemar	this is why using dns names for upstreams is in general a bad idea
2018-01-19 17:08:41	kojiro	in that error log message, the "client: $ip" ip is the correct, internal one
2018-01-19 17:09:03	kojiro	but the `upstream: "https://$otherip:443/..."` bit is the external IP
2018-01-19 17:09:05	vandemar	if you can't set up your web architecture with fixed ips for all the elements that need to be connectable, you're making things unnecessarily difficult for yourself, or you have an incredibly bizarre set of requirements

2018-01-20 06:09:05	merlincorey	jorb: so your assumption is a bit incorrect because as MTecknology explained to you apache and nginx are architecturally and philosophically quite different
2018-01-20 06:09:25	merlincorey	jorb: and it is true, PHP as an application and Apache as an application server play real nice together, lots of time and code has been put into that
2018-01-20 06:09:29	merlincorey	to make it "easy"
2018-01-20 06:09:42	merlincorey	but easy does not mean simple and may not equate to good
2018-01-20 06:09:53	merlincorey	easy just means its easy to do certain things in a certain expected way

2018-01-20 06:10:39	merlincorey	your assumption I would say is incorrect because at least from my perspective, I don't understand your ire given that the Apache configuration you listed requires you to add the extension that you want to be handled

2018-01-20 06:11:11	merlincorey	... do you not think "under the hood" so to speak that might not manifest as routes in the URL being mapped to some kind of backend?
2018-01-20 06:11:28	merlincorey	so yeah, nginx is  more verbose, but that is, to me, a *good* thing, because it is more explicit and simpler
2018-01-20 06:11:32	merlincorey	it may not be as easy
2018-01-20 06:11:41	merlincorey	but nothing is hidden from me, I know exactly what the server is doing and why
2018-01-20 06:12:19	jorb	merlincorey: man, verbose is right
2018-01-20 06:12:21	merlincorey	relying on side effects means you have to keep a lot more in your head when mixing things together or doing things in new ways that are NOT easy by the general path
2018-01-20 06:12:49	merlincorey	whereas with the verbose declarative nature of nginx, it's very straightforward to do exotic things if you need to
2018-01-20 06:13:02	merlincorey	... and it does them at a pretty good clip too!
2018-01-20 06:13:10	merlincorey	so yeah that is magic to some people
2018-01-20 06:13:17	merlincorey	maybe not to you and that's okay :)
2018-01-20 06:13:25	jorb	right, i'll take speed if its tough to config
2018-01-20 06:13:53	jorb	but what i wanted to opine on right now was how i'm seeing f'ing adds for Nginx in my twitter and facebook feeds...
2018-01-20 06:14:05	merlincorey	get yourself a pi-hole
2018-01-20 06:14:09	jorb	i'm so so confused why a piece of server software needs to advertise
2018-01-20 06:14:14	merlincorey	https://pi-hole.net/
2018-01-20 06:14:25	merlincorey	well nginx has an open source component and an enterprise component
2018-01-20 06:14:35	merlincorey	as far as I know most of ushere are just open source folks
2018-01-20 06:14:41	merlincorey	I've been using nginx since 0.5.x for example
2018-01-20 06:14:56	merlincorey	I have never used it in the enterprise configuration
2018-01-20 06:15:25	merlincorey	however, I would assume that it is high quality, and from what I understand, mostly what it does is add modules to increase the ease of use for Enterprises
2018-01-20 06:15:27	jorb	i just thought it was interesting, and also confusing haha
2018-01-20 06:15:57	merlincorey	and a few special types of streaming modules, I would wager
2018-01-20 06:16:24	jorb	there is plenty of room for a better load balancer and proxy in the enterprise, i like it
2018-01-20 06:16:28	merlincorey	like I am faaairly certain that at least at one point and probably currently a portion of Netflix's static hosting is/was FreeBSD + NginX
2018-01-20 06:16:31	merlincorey	I would imagine they have enterprise
2018-01-20 06:17:28	merlincorey	honestly though
2018-01-20 06:17:35	merlincorey	I am pretty hyped on the new haproxy features

2018-01-20 06:21:45	jorb	haproxy was actually my first choice, seemed cool at the time 8-)
2018-01-20 06:22:45	jorb	a lot more options with nginx though, and seemed a lot more straightforward
2018-01-20 06:23:09	jorb	i'm guaranteed to run into the same if not more limitations for PHP + haproxy

2018-01-20 06:25:27	merlincorey	yeah
2018-01-20 06:25:52	merlincorey	I generally go nginx -> backends or sometimes nginx -> happroxy -> backends
2018-01-20 06:26:09	merlincorey	but once in a while I've done haproxy -> nginx -> backends
2018-01-20 06:26:27	merlincorey	and of course, haproxy was the only option for some protocols
2018-01-20 06:26:31	merlincorey	but I think that is changing in nginx soon
2018-01-20 06:26:55	merlincorey	cause they added the ability to proxy any port based on the mail code to enterprise, I think, if I recall reading the news correctly some time ago
2018-01-20 06:29:04	<--	monoxane (~monoxane@monoxane.com) has left #nginx ("The Lounge - https://thelounge.github.io")
2018-01-20 06:34:20	MTecknology	heh.. I actually thought nginx was easier to wrap my head around because it's just doing exactly the things you tell it to.
2018-01-20 06:35:10	jorb	true, it is
2018-01-20 06:35:49	jorb	when things don't just do things for you magically (such as PHP + apache integration) they are doing what you tell them only
2018-01-20 06:36:09	MTecknology	you seem to prefer the magic of apache..
2018-01-20 06:37:19	MTecknology	merlincorey: I want to see haproxy supporting udp!
2018-01-20 06:37:29	merlincorey	MTecknology: that'd be interesting
2018-01-20 06:37:37	merlincorey	but not their wheelhouse really
2018-01-20 06:37:47	merlincorey	also kinda dangerous on the internet, no?
2018-01-20 06:37:54	jorb	not necessarily, but as merlincorey pointed out (i think) there is a bit more of a hand-holding philosophy (hand wavy, black box)
2018-01-20 06:38:18	merlincorey	jorb: yeah p much my point, if your case is the 90% case they aim for its EZ!
2018-01-20 06:38:40	merlincorey	jorb: but have you ever had to look at a mess of apache Rewrite's in .htaccess?
2018-01-20 06:38:46	merlincorey	and figure out wtf is going on....
2018-01-20 06:39:31	merlincorey	nginx explicitly says "fuck .htaccess it is insecure, slow, and makes ugly complicated configurations"
2018-01-20 06:39:57	MTecknology	merlincorey: I'm actually using nginx instead of haproxy because I need udp, but that's also not on the public net.
2018-01-20 06:40:01	merlincorey	that's what won me over to nginx completely after I first started using it as a front end static webserver and caching server with memcached (before nginx had its own caching)
2018-01-20 06:40:38	merlincorey	(and when memcached was still a thing to use rather than anything else :P)

2018-01-20 06:52:26	jorb	just on a default debian box, needed to look at the "default" site for that example... rather than nginx's website

2018-01-20 06:54:59	merlincorey	jorb: that's because the debian configuration has been mangled, but also in the documentation it does explain why the line that is in that file is needed
2018-01-20 06:56:18	merlincorey	jorb: http://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html
2018-01-20 06:56:31	merlincorey	The most basic nginx configuration to work with a FastCGI server includes using the fastcgi_pass directive instead of the proxy_pass directive, and fastcgi_param directives to set parameters passed to a FastCGI server. Suppose the FastCGI server is accessible on localhost:9000. Taking the proxy configuration from the previous section as a basis, replace the proxy_pass directive with the fastcgi_pass
2018-01-20 06:56:37	merlincorey	directive and change the parameter to localhost:9000. In PHP, the SCRIPT_FILENAME parameter is used for determining the script name, and the QUERY_STRING parameter is used to pass request parameters. The resulting configuration would be:

2018-01-20 16:59:23	jottr	Hi all. I'm a bit confused on when I should use the `default_server` directive. I am working on redirecting multiple subdomains from one domain to another. In the server block for the root domain, I have the `default_server`-directive set. In the server block for the subdomains I don't have it set. Now when trying to access the subdomain, nginx does not serve the ssl cert properly: "no "ssl_certificate" is
2018-01-20 16:59:25	jottr	defined in server listening on SSL port while SSL handshaking..."

2018-01-20 17:00:55	jottr	My hunch is, that the `default_server`-directive somehow messes with how the ssl certificates are processed

2018-01-20 17:19:09	vandemar	yes, in no particular order, don't define ssl_protocols if all you're defining it to is the default value.  separate port 80 into its own server block and redirect from there to port 443.  And look for other port 443 ssl server blocks that don't have ssl_certificate defined.
2018-01-20 17:20:02	jottr	vandemar: ok. will try. thank you. :)

2018-01-21 02:10:15	becks`	hi, is it possible to completely remove the Content-Type header with nginx? nginx is the server itself in my case
2018-01-21 02:11:44	merlincorey	becks`: https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/modules/headers_more/
2018-01-21 02:11:54	merlincorey	this has stuff to clear/remove headers for responses
2018-01-21 02:11:59	merlincorey	not sure if core lets you remove it
2018-01-21 02:12:00	merlincorey	just set it
2018-01-21 02:12:24	becks`	thanks, will try this :)
2018-01-21 02:12:26	merlincorey	http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_headers_module.html <<< yeah core module just has "add"

Once I enable the mapping it stops working. Inside the www-redirects.map there is nothing that redirects on /user-registration. What am  I missing?

With that subset, nginx looks in order of preference for 1. server_name match; 2. serverblock with listen ... default_server ; 3. the first parsed server block (this is bad! label a default_server!)

2018-01-21 22:35:43	kaos01	oh ok as in disable the upstream server (node) from listening on ipv6
2018-01-21 22:37:08	Dagger	what's wrong with it going over v6? if it's ESTABLISHED then it's succesfully connecting
2018-01-21 22:37:34	MTecknology	I suspect you're relying on address resolution instead of actually specifying an address, so it gets v6 and then v6 happens because it got a v6 addr
2018-01-21 22:37:48	MTecknology	basic... but of course, I have no way to actually know that
2018-01-21 22:37:49	Dagger	(also, just because it's a "tcp6" socket doesn't mean the connection itself is using v6; v6 sockets can by default handle v4)
2018-01-21 22:38:49	kaos01	well i want to eiminate the ipv6 looksups for now

2018-01-21 23:09:53	hazzy	Hello all, noobie here. I am running nginx 1.10.3 on debian9. Everything is the default config other than what I changed in sites-enabled, which I can post. Problem is that about 20% of the time my site does not load and times out, and possibly related, I can ssh in only once, if I try to ssh in a second time I get a time out. If I ssh in on the local network all it fine. Are these likely to be due to nginx config issues?

2018-01-22 12:20:15	MacroMan	And the line in my config: rewrite ^/blog/\d{3,5}/(.*)?/.*$ http://local.test/blog/$1;

2018-01-22 12:25:22	benbrown	in what way does it not work? Does the redirect not happen, or is the redirect incorrect?
2018-01-22 12:25:34	MacroMan	It doesn't redirect, so it doesn't match

2018-01-22 14:42:48	abyss	I'd like to limit to GET for certain address and for other's IPs or methods I'd like to deny all. If it possible without using if? Or the only way is if $remote_addr == myip {then limit_except GET } else {deny all}?
2018-01-22 14:42:48	vegardx	You can use maps
2018-01-22 14:42:48	vegardx	But you likely still have to use ifs, yes.
2018-01-22 14:42:48	vegardx	But in this scenario that is perfectly acceptable, since you have to evaluate every request to do that anyway.

2018-01-22 16:40:06	zaraf	Hello! I am using nginx (listening on port 80) to local-proxy to a node app that is running on port 3001. The node app is an API that returns (constantly changing) JSON and my problem is that when I access it via port 80 (through nginx) the result gets cached, when I access it through 3001 all is well (and after that 80 returns the last result from 3001 and doesn't change again). All I am doing is "proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3001;" in
2018-01-22 16:40:33	zaraf	I tried a lot of random cache/proxy cache settings I found in the manual/stackoverflow but I can't seem to find the one that will fix this :/

2018-01-23 16:23:14	benbrown	nginx doesn't rotate logs. Look at your system level log rotation

2018-01-23 16:32:19	toadthewetsocket	I have an edge NGINX server and serves content from a static content server behind it.
2018-01-23 16:32:50	toadthewetsocket	When I make changes to to the static index.html for example.  The change will only show up when the cache expires.
2018-01-23 16:32:58	jaybe	sounds like caching
2018-01-23 16:33:09	toadthewetsocket	Seems no matter what I do.  I can't get nginx to realize that the file has changed.
2018-01-23 16:34:27	toadthewetsocket	it's definitely a caching issue.  But from what I understand.  Nginx is supposed to use a number of techniques to make sure it captures content that has change.
2018-01-23 16:34:29	toadthewetsocket	changed
2018-01-23 16:34:33	toadthewetsocket	none of which are working.
2018-01-23 16:34:51	jdewald	it's not going to optimistically re-request content that it doesn't believe has expired

2018-01-23 16:38:57	jdewald	those are only used to determine whether the file has changed at re-validation time, good for larger content (so it can 304 rather than 200)
2018-01-23 16:39:19	jdewald	Can be used in conjunction with very short expiration times

2018-01-23 16:44:21	toadthewetsocket	Hmmm
2018-01-23 16:44:39	toadthewetsocket	I have must revalidate set but perhaps it's not doing what I think it's doing.
2018-01-23 16:45:46	toadthewetsocket	I guess etags don't do what I thought they were doing either.

I get the 403 when i try to bring up anything on the server. I have made sure that the files are owned by nginx:nginx  and the index is set properly. The rwx permissions are set properly as well. I've verified that the worker is running and owned by nginx. Any other

2018-01-24 01:34:44	vandemar	.* matches any number of segments.  usually in a regex like that you want to match one segment, and you don't want it to be empty either, because that would be collapsed (see `merge_slashes') by default and wouldn't match anyway.  Even if you disabled slash merging, you wouldn't want anything to match /sites//files/filename, right?

2018-01-24 04:11:48	Tinned_Tuna	Hi, I'm trying to (as a learning exercise) configure NGinx to select back-ends at random. In this scenario I have a process killing a random back-end every 20 - 30s, and they take ~1s to recover. When I measure the availability of the backend directly it's higher than when I measure it through NGinx.

2018-01-24 04:14:02	Tinned_Tuna	Why is the measured availability lower when going through NGinx (which can route to any of two backends) rather than going direct?

2018-01-24 06:52:40	Tinned_Tuna	Kabiigon, what's your question?
2018-01-24 06:53:04	Kabiigon	I set everything up proper
2018-01-24 06:53:11	Kabiigon	The only difference is the os
2018-01-24 06:54:01	Kabiigon	Then I realized something that my fedora install is only using 1.10.2 while cents is using 1.12.2
2018-01-24 06:54:14	Kabiigon	Im migrating from cantos to fedora
2018-01-24 06:55:11	Kabiigon	How do I update fedora 24 1.10.2 to the latest version
2018-01-24 06:56:05	Tinned_Tuna	Is your NGinx on Fedora is package managed?
2018-01-24 06:56:11	Tinned_Tuna	i.e. handled through yum or dnf?
2018-01-24 06:56:42	Kabiigon	yeah
2018-01-24 06:56:47	Kabiigon	dnf
2018-01-24 06:57:23	Tinned_Tuna	If dnf update / dnf upgrade doesn't do it you'll need to update to Fedora 27 to get the latest NGinx.
2018-01-24 06:57:56	Kabiigon	Problem is that vps hosts is having issues with later versions
2018-01-24 06:58:02	Kabiigon	Can I install manuall
2018-01-24 06:58:28	Tinned_Tuna	Fedora 24 is EoL, so you're probably not getting security updates which might be a much more serious issue.

2018-01-24 07:00:09	Tinned_Tuna	I'd expect that you might be able to make something work by grabbing the RPMs.
2018-01-24 07:03:35	Tinned_Tuna	You should be able to navigate to the RPM mirrors using the contents of /etc/yum.repos.d/*, but beyond that you'll need to get Fedora-specific help. I expect they'll probably tell you to upgrade though :-/

2018-01-24 17:00:35	desnudopenguino	is there a way to keep nonexisting subdomains from loading the content of .com? for example something.mydomain.com is loading the content of mydomain.com
2018-01-24 17:01:23	alanhuang	sounds like you've fallen into the pitfall of
2018-01-24 17:01:27	alanhuang	!default_server
2018-01-24 17:01:27	@ngxbot	Nginx considers either a) all * / 0.0.0.0 / [::] listening blocks, or b) If any exist, serverblocks with listen lines with the specific ip matching the ip the request arrived on. With that subset, nginx looks in order of preference for 1. server_name match; 2. serverblock with listen ... default_server ; 3. the first parsed server block (this is bad! label a default_server!)

2018-01-24 17:02:04	alanhuang	basically, I bet you don't have a default_server labelled, and so nginx serves the first server block in the config, which I'm betting is mydomain.com
2018-01-24 17:02:35	alanhuang	of course, that assumes that something.mydomain.com resolves to the same IP

2018-01-25 05:29:33	@ngxbot	Use `curl` for testing. Seriously. Check configs with `nginx -t`, then reload. Browser caching causes phantom issues. Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.

The server blocks from 163-202 and 236-244 don't have any effect on things. Furthermore, those two server blocks appear *outside* the http block, even though the includes that grabs them is inside the http block. I'm very confused by this.

2018-01-25 11:08:44	benbrown	Lope: have you seen the `primer' - it briefly covers php
2018-01-25 11:08:44	@ngxbot	Primer is: http://blog.martinfjordvald.com/2010/07/nginx-primer/
2018-01-25 11:08:46	Lope	I've got nginx running, when I open index.html it's fine. When I open index.php the nginx error log says connect() failed (111: Connection refused) while connecting to upstream, client: 127.0.0.1, server: localhost, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "fastcgi://127.0.0.1:9000"
2018-01-25 11:09:01	berckoff	is there any limitation on subdomains handling for nginx?
2018-01-25 11:09:07	benbrown	berckoff: no
2018-01-25 11:09:07	Lope	benbrown: thanks I'll look
2018-01-25 11:09:23	Lope	netstat -lntup doesn't indicate that FPM is listening.
2018-01-25 11:09:41	benbrown	Lope: looks like you've configured nginx to try to connect to php-fpm via a local connection but php-fpm isn't configured to listen there
2018-01-25 11:09:56	benbrown	It's probably using a socket instead. check the php-fpm config

2018-01-25 11:19:43	@ngxbot	Every parent dir needs +x perms for the nginx user (or the userid of the process reading the file). Check with: `namei -om /path/to/file`. If symlinks are involved, make SURE they aren't broken. Chroots must have access to the right paths. Ensure MAC systems (e.g. SELinux, Apparmor) don't interfere. See !index if 403s result from directory access. wiki: goo.gl/tt4hbz

2018-01-25 11:29:16	berckoff	it was working with gitlab.hostname and when i changed it to the shorter "git", it stopped and even doesn't resolve to the main one

2018-01-25 11:32:08	vandemar	if the main domain resolves and the cname you think you have doesn't resolve, obviously the cname isn't really set up right

2018-01-25 11:35:24	vandemar	computerfoo: no idea, but meanwhile move the syslog access log line to the location / block, that'll solve your problem right?
2018-01-25 11:38:38	computerfoo	vandemar: That would most likely solve the problem, but seems a bit hacky. ;) And since the `server` part of all domains is configured via configuration-management, I'd have to do this for a lot of locations :/
2018-01-25 11:39:05	computerfoo	vandemar: btw: Thanks a lot for helping
2018-01-25 11:42:49	benbrown	berckoff: does it work with `curl'?
2018-01-25 11:42:50	@ngxbot	Use `curl` for testing. Seriously. Check configs with `nginx -t`, then reload. Browser caching causes phantom issues. Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.
2018-01-25 11:43:51	berckoff	@benbrown: havent't tested to be honest
2018-01-25 11:44:20	berckoff	with pinging the host - it is resolved to the main domain (as supposed)
2018-01-25 11:44:44	vandemar	you're testing dns resolution with ping?  how about using DNS tools like dig to test it?

2018-01-25 14:48:53	boddah	but I wanted to map to $remote_user instead. not sure if that's possible somehow though
2018-01-25 14:50:23	FinalX	you can't override $remote_user, but you can create a new var and use that in its stead in most places
2018-01-25 14:50:54	boddah	yeah, that's what I'm trying to avoid because I don't want to change the log_format standard here :(
2018-01-25 14:51:32	FinalX	keep in mind that you should not rely on CN as per 2011 RFC's things start moving to SAN instead

2018-01-25 17:08:43	jenia	I need to send a HUP signal from the worker to the master process
2018-01-25 17:08:55	jenia	but when I do so, I get "operation not permitted" from the OS
2018-01-25 17:09:23	jenia	how do I get around this?

2018-01-25 17:12:58	jenia	benbrown: the problem is that nginx master runs as root
2018-01-25 17:13:05	jenia	but not the workers

2018-01-25 17:21:48	benbrown	Ahh, that's a bit beyond my abilities. Maybe someone else will have an idea. You might also be able to get more information on one of the mailing lists
2018-01-25 17:22:09	jenia	this HUP signaling and shared memory design is all over internet. One thing missing: how to deal with the damn fact that the master process runs as root
2018-01-25 17:22:33	jenia	benbrown: what if I run nginx as nobody?
2018-01-25 17:22:34	jenia	:)
2018-01-25 17:23:07	benbrown	You could do, you'd have to use a port <1024, or set up cap_net_something (I can never remember what it's called)
2018-01-25 17:23:54	benbrown	The reason I suggest the mailing list is that developers are there, and there may be a way they prefer for handling shared memory in nginx

2018-01-25 20:26:58	SmokedCheese	if you'll request /ydl/meowmeow with that config, your upstream will recive request with same uri

2018-01-25 20:27:07	@ngxbot	A webapp in a subdirectory (eg //site/app/approute) is tricky if it's not your app, the app expects paths to be /approute instead of /app/approute, and you can't use hardcoding or send custom headers to tell the app its /app path prefix. Solutions: use subdomains instead of subdirs, or keep the request path unchanged for the backend.

No need to pass on the query string for the urls who have one present. I will however need to redirect other URIs on the same server.
2018-01-26 01:22:31	jottr	Edit. I don't need to check if a certain query string is present, but just if the URL contains a query string at all.

I've adjusted the post_max_size, upload_max_filesize, and memory_limit to 128M. I altered it in /etc/php/fpm-php7.2/php.ini. Is this the right file to do so for a nginx server. It doesn't seem to be taking effect after a nginx restart.

2018-01-26 09:47:58	ntt	Hello, I need to redirect all http requests from http://mydomain.org:12127 to http://another_domain.org:8080/path1 . mydomain.org is hosted though nginx and another_domain.org is managed using apache tomcat. Both virtual hosts resides on the same machine, so I'm using proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/path1 but the problem is that I see 127.0.0.1 as source ip of the requests in the log generated by tomcat. How can I solve? Thank you

2018-01-26 12:42:18	benbrown	Any others?
2018-01-26 12:42:43	benbrown	Also if you try with `curl' -v are there any clues in the headers? e.g. X-Powered-By: php
2018-01-26 12:42:43	@ngxbot	Use `curl` for testing. Seriously. Check configs with `nginx -t`, then reload. Browser caching causes phantom issues. Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.
2018-01-26 12:42:45	Diplomat	Hm just found that I have a caching location block too for images
2018-01-26 12:42:56	benbrown	ahh - that's probably it
2018-01-26 12:43:02	benbrown	move the rewrite there
2018-01-26 12:43:06	Diplomat	And thats why there's no logs too

2018-01-26 12:48:07	Diplomat	Yeah, I commented out that caching block and it works fine now.. Have to figure out a way to combine them

2018-01-26 12:54:01	benbrown	that's why there's nothing in the log
2018-01-26 12:54:30	benbrown	You can either move it to that block, or use ^~ in your location

2018-01-26 14:38:31	DammitJim	then I started thinking it would be good to separate my customers to have separate virtual IPs
2018-01-26 14:38:50	DammitJim	but now that I'm working on 1 of the customres I'm starting to feel like I should be setting up a different IP for different service groups

2018-01-26 14:39:05	benbrown	OK, so you'll want to set up server blocks for your customers, and use their ips in `listen'
2018-01-26 14:39:05	@ngxbot	http://ngx.cc/r/listen || When a request arrives, if any server blocks listen explicitly on that connection's server-side IP address, ONLY those server blocks are considered. Otherwise, all wildcard-ip (omitted/0.0.0.0/*/ [::] ) listening blocks for the connection's protocol (ipv4 or ipv6) are considered.

2018-01-26 15:37:45	thresh	create a separate server{} block, point to to the backend you control, set the cache key to the same as used in a regular server block, and fetch the file.

2018-01-26 15:44:47	mamalos	in fact I don't need to touch the cache. All I need is to be able to serve a specific content when a specific path is provided.

2018-01-28 18:56:19	@ngxbot	v7: If you want to enforce ssl: server { listen 80; server_name your.hostname.com; return 302 https://$host$request_uri; } || A wise set of bits once wrote: 302 + HSTS is a way better solution [than 301] for http=>https
2018-01-28 18:56:19	V7	Yes, but this will send people for every subdomain which they would type. Isn't it ?
2018-01-28 18:56:19	V7	Which doesn't exist *
2018-01-28 18:56:19	vandemar	server_name your.hostname.com;  is NOT "every subdomain"
2018-01-28 18:56:19	V7	Yes, and this will work. But i.e. if person would type your2.hostname.com and it doesn't configured it'll send person to hostname.com isn't it ?
2018-01-28 18:56:19	jaybe	!default_server
2018-01-28 18:56:19	@ngxbot	When nginx has selected a subset of server blocks (see !listen), nginx uses in order of preference 1. A server_name match; 2. A server block with listen ... default_server; 3. The first server block in parsing order, which becomes the default_server (this is bad! always label a default_server for each ip:port !)
2018-01-28 18:56:19	vandemar	he's already been shown that multiple times :(
2018-01-28 18:56:19	jaybe	!server_name
2018-01-28 18:56:19	@ngxbot	http://ngx.cc/r/server_name
2018-01-28 18:56:19	jaybe	those are the answers, so...
2018-01-28 18:56:19	V7	You don't understand my question I think.
2018-01-28 18:56:19	V7	I'll try explain with other words
2018-01-28 18:56:19	jaybe	that must be it
2018-01-28 18:56:19	V7	Imagine that we've already created two subdomains, adnd we have default_server. So also we have section "server { listen 80 ... }" for every subdomain and domain, but this also sends person to default_server if he would type unexisted subdomain ( i.e. foo.hostname.com ) isn' it ?
2018-01-28 18:56:19	jaybe	default server is the default server to send non explicit traffic
2018-01-28 18:56:19	V7	So is it possible to show 404 page if person would type wrong (unexisting) subdomain
2018-01-28 18:56:19	jaybe	sure
2018-01-28 18:56:19	V7	So there's only one solution: " set up another domain that contains only a 404 page, and have that be the first domain listed. You can then add as many specific domains as you like; the first one will only be used when there's no other matching domain name in the config file." ? Is it ?
2018-01-28 18:56:19	vandemar	No, I think you've got the meaning of default_server backwards.
2018-01-28 18:56:19	V7	What do you mean ?
2018-01-28 18:56:19	vandemar	pastebin your full config and stop obscuring your hostname so we can actually check things, otherwise this is going to continue being *very* tedious
2018-01-28 18:56:19	V7	ah sorry I can't. This hostname isn't mine. So I can't send it because I don't know if it's real owner would accept this request.
2018-01-28 18:56:19	V7	mb
2018-01-28 18:56:19	vandemar	then find a russian to ask.  the language barrier isn't helping, I suspect
2018-01-28 18:56:19	MTecknology	OMG! My url is super private!
2018-01-28 18:56:19	vandemar	I IZ HOSTING TOP SECRET RUSSIAN NUCLEAR LAUNCH CODES! CANNOT GIVE YOU URL!  PLZ HELP ME ANYWAY
2018-01-28 18:56:19	V7	vandemar, I can understand your talk, but "backwards" word caused some missunderstanding
2018-01-28 18:56:19	V7	?
2018-01-28 18:56:19	vandemar	it must be either porn or warez or hacking
2018-01-28 18:56:19	V7	?
2018-01-28 18:56:19	V7	btw vandemar and jaybe thank you very much for the help
2018-01-28 18:56:19	V7	also vandemar I'm not russian, but domain
2018-01-28 18:56:19	V7	Sorry if I've told something wrong or unacceptable
2018-01-28 18:56:19	vandemar	not unacceptable, just unproductive.  pastebin your full config (nginx -T) and substitute domain.ru with example.ru
2018-01-28 18:56:19	vandemar	example.ru is for sale!  Quick!  Someone pay the domain squatter millions of dollars for it!
2018-01-28 18:56:19	jaybe	he needs to understand wtf `listen' and `default_server' are for, and do... and leverage that information to get what he thinks he wants.
2018-01-28 18:56:19	@ngxbot	http://ngx.cc/r/listen || When a request arrives, if any server blocks listen explicitly on that connection's server-side IP address, ONLY those server blocks are considered. Otherwise, all wildcard-ip (omitted/0.0.0.0/*/ [::] ) listening blocks for the connection's protocol (ipv4 or ipv6) are considered. Then, with that subset ONLY, host-based selection starts: See !default_server

2018-01-28 18:56:19	tempus_fol	Hello, I'm trying to understand the role of the question mark in the replacement string as ngx_http_rewrite_module page. I read "If a replacement string includes the new request arguments, the previous request arguments are appended after them" but I can't exactly guess what it means.
2018-01-28 18:56:19	tempus_fol	*in the ngx_http_rewrite_module page ( https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_rewrite_module.html ). Btw, I can't guess if appending "?" is generally advisable and which pitfalls prevents
2018-01-28 18:56:19	vandemar	tempus_fol: what does your rewrite look like?
2018-01-28 18:56:19	vandemar	tempus_fol: it's really simple.  Adding a trailing ? suppresses the default rewrite behavior of appending the original ?args string
2018-01-28 18:56:19	tempus_fol	vandemar: thank you for your reply, I haven't made use of such a rewrite rule, I'm investigating the behavior. So ` rewrite ^/users/(.*)$ /show?user=$1? last; ' would rewrite /users/john?239 to /show/?user=john , whereas ` rewrite ^/users/(.*)$ /show?user=$1 last; ' would rewrite /users/john?239 to /show/?user=john?239, correct?
2018-01-28 18:56:19	tempus_fol	well, I've checked with `rewrite_log on' and in the second case I see `args: "user=john&239"' in the error log while in the first case I see `args: "user=john"' so this may answer the question

2018-02-07 11:26:08	iron_houzi	..since location blocks cannot be defined outside of a server context, I don't see an immediate solution apart from straight up copy..
2018-02-07 11:26:29	FinalX	iron_houzi: I'd put them in a file, and include that file in both locations.
2018-02-07 11:26:36	FinalX	or,
2018-02-07 11:27:13	FinalX	no, not or :) but you will need to put the return 307 in a location / {} in the 80 block
2018-02-07 11:27:31	FinalX	because otherwise it'll always hit the return and never see the other location-blocks you're going to put there
2018-02-07 11:27:38	iron_houzi	FinalX: Indeed, I was thinking that I might need that, thanks for confirming!

2018-02-07 19:06:47	@ngxbot	Use `curl` for testing. Seriously. Check configs with `nginx -t`, then reload. Browser caching causes phantom issues. Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.

2018-02-07 20:37:16	dka	but I need a vpn
2018-02-07 20:37:35	teward	if it's intranet that's the proper way to do it.  *why* are you trying to make an intranet-only resource internet-accessible
2018-02-07 20:37:39	dka	Gitlab page doesn't allow any security if a site is public, we use nginx as a front proxy
2018-02-07 20:37:44	dka	the probleme is between these two proxy
2018-02-07 20:37:49	dka	we need to rewrite to have the proper host
2018-02-07 20:37:52	dka	can nginx do that ?
2018-02-07 20:38:09	dka	It may be an intranet only resource
2018-02-07 20:38:17	dka	It can be public if a front proxy is set up
2018-02-07 20:38:20	dka	which is what i am trying to achieve
2018-02-07 20:39:17	dka	the reason why we do like this is thaT Gitlab page doesn't provide any user permissions and everything is public. I dont see how it can be done differently
2018-02-07 20:40:21	teward	dka: you can theoretically hide the original header then set a different header, but that's not a rewrite, because you are using a wildcard which will cause problems with that.  The only way to properly rewrite that would be, I believe, a script that would do that, and that usually means Lua or similar scripting with those plugins for nginx...
2018-02-07 20:40:32	teward	if you need to match * to a specific backend, of course, that explodes and fails.

2018-02-08 00:54:53	V7	So imagine that index.php shows 404 then it call databases an so on
2018-02-08 00:55:13	V7	Because 404 page will cause to check if user is authenticated or such

2018-02-08 11:48:07	@ngxbot	We need more configuration details to help you further. Please provide your *entire* server configuration(s) to OUR pastebin (only) at http://p.ngx.cc/. `nginx -T` w/ nginx 1.10+. Remember to include any `include` files. If obfuscating hostnames, use rfc2606 domains like "example.com". Note that keeps anyone from helping you diagnose hostname/DNS/SSL(sni) type problems.
2018-02-08 11:48:28	benbrown	Guest72344: it'll use whatever's the `default_server' for that ip:port combination
2018-02-08 11:48:29	@ngxbot	When nginx has selected a subset of server blocks (see !listen), nginx uses in order of preference 1. A server_name match; 2. A server block with listen ... default_server; 3. The first server block in parsing order, which becomes the default_server (this is bad! always label a default_server for each ip:port !)

2018-02-08 11:54:38	dka	Sorry, I must correct what I've just wrote, I end up on gitlab while I expect gitlab to use a complete different domain, AND the project page should be accessed at /plain-html (project name) and this with SSL return 404

2018-02-08 18:17:07	benbrown	Also you should probably set a `default_server'
2018-02-08 18:17:08	@ngxbot	When nginx has selected a subset of server blocks (see !listen), nginx uses in order of preference 1. A server_name match; 2. A server block with listen ... default_server; 3. The first server block in parsing order, which becomes the default_server (this is bad! always label a default_server for each ip:port !)

2018-02-08 18:20:04	benbrown	Ok, so you have some other config already using that ip:port combination, which is most likely where your request is ending up
2018-02-08 18:20:35	benbrown	server_name is unnecessary in a default_server, but you can only have one of those per ip:port
2018-02-08 18:20:45	Guest28743	benbrown: sorry for the confusion, but this is a .conf file in conf.d

2018-02-08 23:45:38	toadthewetsprock	Is there a good way to perform an include within an include ?
2018-02-08 23:45:39	deed02392	MTecknology: was that to me?
2018-02-08 23:45:46	MTecknology	deed02392: yes
2018-02-08 23:46:09	toadthewetsprock	I don't want to keep repeating configuration items but it's starting to look like I am not going to have a choice.
2018-02-08 23:46:12	MTecknology	toadthewetsprock: if needed, then do that thing you said?
2018-02-08 23:46:21	deed02392	MTecknology: OK, because I want to disable http2 that is enabled inline by the listen line, is that possible? sorry for the weird use case but I am using a dockerised nginx version
2018-02-08 23:46:40	MTecknology	don't enable it in the first place if you don't want it
2018-02-08 23:46:59	toadthewetsprock	MTecknology: I am not following.  I tried to perform and include within and included file and it spit fire.
2018-02-08 23:47:02	deed02392	MTecknology: yeah it's not that simple for me. are you saying it's impossible to override it if it has been enabled in the listen line?
2018-02-08 23:47:28	vandemar	it's *your* listen line, in *your* config.  why is it there if you don't want it?
2018-02-08 23:47:45	deed02392	vandemar: jwilder/nginx-proxy docker container enables it
2018-02-08 23:47:56	deed02392	the config is auto generated based on my containers and http2 is enabled in the listen directive
2018-02-08 23:48:22	deed02392	i cannot replace it without overriding and then having to manage the default server{} block for ALL containers
2018-02-08 23:48:46	vandemar	then make your own modified container or live with http2.  what's wrong with http2 anyway?
2018-02-08 23:49:14	deed02392	vandemar: http2 is somehow causing a SPDY protocol error on one container in particular that uses long polling REST api calls
2018-02-08 23:49:17	toadthewetsprock	deed02392: I second that. What' wrong with http2?  I am curious.
2018-02-08 23:49:55	deed02392	sure, thanks for being curious. this is the ultimate problem I am trying to solve: https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4731
2018-02-08 23:50:05	toadthewetsprock	deed02392: I saw a simliar issue once and it was actually a header causing spdy to break
2018-02-08 23:50:10	vandemar	that's pretty vague but I'm guessing you have some out of date client that's trying to use spdy, and it has nothing to do with http2?
2018-02-08 23:50:29	deed02392	vandemar: nah, latest version of Chrome, and it's been happening over versions of chrome for months
2018-02-08 23:50:37	deed02392	toadthewetsprock: from the REST client perhaps?
2018-02-08 23:50:50	toadthewetsprock	Post you config?
2018-02-08 23:50:53	vandemar	what's the exact error and where's it being shown?
2018-02-08 23:51:04	toadthewetsprock	The issue I saw was a : in the actual header that was being sent to the browser.

2018-02-08 23:54:42	deed02392	they are published here: https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy#replacing-default-proxy-settings
2018-02-08 23:54:50	jdewald	That's a Chrome thing, it reports errors as SPDY_ERROR
2018-02-08 23:55:21	jdewald	I've seen this if a response includes an overly large header, there are some limits on the Chrome side (Safari actually handles it differently)
2018-02-08 23:55:28	deed02392	i am just waiting for the error to occur again so I can see if I can provide you with the headers that are sent from the server
2018-02-08 23:55:54	MTecknology	toadthewetsprock: based on the error you provided, I can only assume you did something wrong
2018-02-08 23:56:14	toadthewetsprock	MTecknology: wouldn't be the first time
2018-02-08 23:56:21	jdewald	I think, annoyingly, 5xx errors generated by origins can cause nginx's HTTP2 handling to flip out

2018-02-08 23:57:42	deed02392	I have triggered the error again but clicking on it in Chrome's dev console takes me to the Network tab but not to the request itself

2018-02-08 23:58:05	jdewald	you may need to bring up Chrome's spdy tool

2018-02-09 00:06:28	deed02392	actually, yes! [error] 46#46: *133 upstream timed out (110: Connection timed out) while reading upstream
2018-02-09 00:07:19	jdewald	yeah, it's annoying how that propagates up... arguably an NGINX bug, but maybe just increasing your proxy_read_timeout will get you past it
2018-02-09 00:08:05	deed02392	ha, interesting. so, i got a timeout in nginx waiting for upstream, and this can result in SPDY protocol errors
2018-02-09 00:08:07	deed02392	right?
2018-02-09 00:08:12	jdewald	yes
2018-02-09 00:08:35	jdewald	generally a 5xx from an upstream causes it to close the whole http2 connection somewhat ungracefully
2018-02-09 00:08:59	jdewald	There may be a config setting to fix that, but I haven't encountered it

2018-02-09 00:09:38	deed02392	the 500 if anything is generated within nginx
2018-02-09 00:09:47	jdewald	That's correct, sorry
2018-02-09 00:09:47	deed02392	upstream hasn't responded i suppose
2018-02-09 00:09:50	deed02392	ok
2018-02-09 00:10:07	jdewald	It ends up as a 5xx from the upstream module itself, which closes the connection
2018-02-09 00:10:10	deed02392	thanks a lot for your help. i have configured a longer proxy timeout, and shall see if i can cause the spdy error again
2018-02-09 00:10:16	jdewald	good luck!
2018-02-09 00:10:29	deed02392	it shouldn't take long to tell, it was a pretty consistent error! thanks!

2018-02-09 11:25:05	HannesP	Hi, I'm creating a Docker image based on nginx, where the end user should be able to optionally mount a volume containing TLS certificates. How do I best deal with absense of certificates? Nginx won't start if it cannot load the files supplied in the config, but I want them to be *optional*. Maybe I'm best off creating two separate Docker images, one for HTTP and one for HTTPS and then let the end user
2018-02-09 11:25:11	HannesP	choose between them?

2018-02-09 16:53:37	ludo2	I have a website that is iframed from other websites.
2018-02-09 16:54:31	ludo2	But, for security reasons (clickjacking), it's now disabled for few browser because of X-Frame-Options .
2018-02-09 16:56:25	ludo2	I don't know how other websites like www.openstreetmap.org encountourned this technical challenge.
2018-02-09 16:57:50	ludo2	Is-there a good way to allow other sites to iframed mine without security problem and/or without recents browsers blockage?

2018-02-10 11:52:35	evagelos	I have setup letsencrypt and the server blocks to redirect to https and everything works fine except the one subdomain :/
2018-02-10 11:54:31	evagelos	Both configs use the upstream which point to 2 docker containers.
2018-02-10 11:55:02	evagelos	I changed the config of the subdomain that fails to proxy_pass to google and seems that works :/

2018-02-10 11:55:54	vandemar	!curl
2018-02-10 11:55:54	@ngxbot	Use `curl` for testing. Seriously. Check configs with `nginx -t`, then reload. Browser caching causes phantom issues. Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.
2018-02-10 11:55:59	vandemar	!details
2018-02-10 11:55:59	@ngxbot	We NEED more details to help you! Explain, simply- what you expect to happen, how you are testing, and your results. Test with curl. Keep comments succinct and factual. Do NOT spam the enter key and don't say "it doesn't work". Paste server configuration(s) using OUR pastebin (see topic). Check nginx error logs for relevant messages. Why all this? see !whydetails !problem

2018-02-10 12:04:24	vandemar	Assuming you have not told nginx to send redirects, the backend (app) is sending redirects because it's not happy with the hostname it's being accessed through.

2018-02-12 15:50:38	Rembo	i want apache to work without nginx
2018-02-12 15:50:58	Rembo	i have a online game and it require only apache server
2018-02-12 15:51:05	jaybe	rembo, ask somewhere appropriate and relevant

2018-02-12 15:51:22	jaybe	that is system and package management related.
2018-02-12 15:51:24	Rembo	now i'm using nginx instead of apache or both
2018-02-12 15:51:25	vandemar	you run a distro and you don't know how to use its package management?
2018-02-12 15:51:55	catphish	assuming you use a package manager, "apt remove nginx" seems like all you'd need, of course installing and configuring apache is somewhat beyond the scope of this channel
2018-02-12 15:52:01	Rembo	vandemar, it is also a webpanel named ISPManager installed who manage the package
2018-02-12 15:52:02	Rembo	s
2018-02-12 15:52:13	catphish	Rembo: so use the web panel
2018-02-12 15:52:14	Sweepyoface	so seek support with them
2018-02-12 15:52:21	jaybe	also system and package management telated and not nginx related

2018-02-12 15:53:35	sobel	benbrown: thanks, i ended up with a distribution (openresty) that put conf and conf.d parallel, but the examples i had all had conf.d/*.conf indicated, and it was a bit of confusion before i got it sorted out. didn't help that i'd already directed stderr to /dev/stderr for docker logging, and wasn't seeing all the error messages :/
2018-02-12 15:53:39	jaybe	by learning how your distribution and package management works
2018-02-12 15:53:43	catphish	as others have said, this isn't really an nxinx question at all :(

2018-02-12 17:48:53	dka_	(ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED) , why does nginx send to the client this (private) dns and why does it try to use it as a host address ?
2018-02-12 17:49:21	dka_	How can I prevent nginx to do that ?
2018-02-12 17:49:42	benbrown	nginx probably isn't doing that, it's more likely whatever you're proxying to that's doing that

2018-02-12 17:51:18	dka_	benbrown, I have tried with Chrome on my smartphone  and with firefox, this bug is only with chrome. I have tried within chrome to clear the host cache but that didn't succeed

2018-02-12 17:55:06	dka_	benbrown, is it possible that the DNS server is producing that ? It started to behave like this since I moved in this hotel due
2018-02-12 17:55:29	dka_	fact is I can't reach my app
2018-02-12 17:55:41	benbrown	Then it's even less likely to be a problem with nginx
2018-02-12 17:56:01	dka_	I've fixed the dns  since to 8.8.8.8 and it's not working better
2018-02-12 17:56:18	dka_	I have something that produce a redirection , any idea where i should ask?

Please provide your *entire* server configuration(s) to OUR pastebin (only) at http://p.ngx.cc/. `nginx -T` w/ nginx 1.10+. Remember to include any `include` files. If obfuscating hostnames, use rfc2606 domains like "example.com". Note that keeps anyone from helping you diagnose hostname/DNS/SSL(sni) type problems.
2018-02-12 17:56:37	benbrown	though from what you've said it not likely to be that
2018-02-12 17:57:13	dka_	I bet you are right, the vhost looks very basic

2018-02-12 17:59:32	benbrown	could be anything. Browser cache, ISP doing something weird, your app doing something weird
2018-02-12 17:59:49	benbrown	`curl' is often useful to diagnose problems
2018-02-12 17:59:49	@ngxbot	Use `curl` for testing. Seriously. Check configs with `nginx -t`, then reload. Browser caching causes phantom issues. Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.

2018-02-12 22:31:40	vandemar	so far you've provided no evidence that there is really a redirect (see `curl') or that nginx has anything to do with the redirect if there is one (since the location you wrote isn't going to work).
2018-02-12 22:31:40	@ngxbot	Use `curl` for testing. Seriously. Check configs with `nginx -t`, then reload. Browser caching causes phantom issues. Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.

Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.

2018-02-13 03:17:45	xtheosirian	Hello, I need some help configuring nginx to use a custom domain with a reverse proxy.
2018-02-13 03:17:51	xtheosirian	https://paste.ngx.cc/9c25557f0832c071
2018-02-13 03:18:31	xtheosirian	The situation is as follow:
2018-02-13 03:18:37	xtheosirian	- server.adomain.com -> $IP (A);
2018-02-13 03:18:42	xtheosirian	- mydomain.com -> $IP2 (A); //unrelated server
2018-02-13 03:18:46	xtheosirian	- project.mydomain.com -> $IP (A);
2018-02-13 03:18:51	xtheosirian	In the server the configuration maps a couple subdomains by rewriting:
2018-02-13 03:18:55	xtheosirian	- user.server.adomain.com/software/etc -> server.adomain.com/user/software/etc
2018-02-13 03:18:55	--	Mode #nginx [+q xtheosirian!*@*] by ngxbot
2018-02-13 03:24:28	--	Mode #nginx [+o Peng_] by ChanServ
2018-02-13 03:24:34	--	Mode #nginx [-q xtheosirian!*@*] by Peng_
2018-02-13 03:24:55	@Peng_	xtheosirian: ngxbot asks you to talk more slowly. :X
2018-02-13 03:25:54	xtheosirian	and then proxy passing some stuff and/or serving php:
2018-02-13 03:26:16	xtheosirian	- server.adomain.com/user/software/etc -> localhost:port/etc
2018-02-13 03:26:31	xtheosirian	for a couple softwares. My configuration is supposed to work alongside it, it should go from
2018-02-13 03:26:52	xtheosirian	- project.mydomain.com/etc -> localhost:$projectPort/etc
2018-02-13 03:27:14	xtheosirian	But I don't have any idea why it's not working.
2018-02-13 03:28:09	xtheosirian	I have `curl -i project.mydomain.com` returning the same as the `curl -i server.adomain.com`.
2018-02-13 03:28:09	xtheosirian	 And I'm getting requests on project's log that are coming from the other softwares.

However, we would really appreciate it if you could keep each thought on one line. Enter "spam" adds extra scroll back, makes things harder to read, and makes it hard to know when your thought is done. Please and thank-you. :D

2018-02-13 06:29:01	@ngxbot	Use `curl` for testing. Seriously. Check configs with `nginx -t`, then reload. Browser caching causes phantom issues. Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.

2018-02-13 09:35:22	Nerdmind	Hi. Is it not possible to override the global ssl_protocol settings? There is the line "ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;" in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf before the "include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;". If I define "ssl_protocols TLSv1.2" in /etc/nginx/conf.d/modifications.conf, then it will not work. TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 is still enabled. What I am doing wrong?

2018-02-13 09:56:03	Nerdmind	Hi
2018-02-13 09:56:03	Papinak	I'd like to ask which CN should have certificate behind nginx proxy. Should it be public CN (like my-app.org)?
2018-02-13 09:56:21	Papinak	I have nginx proxy and app
2018-02-13 09:56:28	Papinak	's proxy
2018-02-13 09:56:42	Papinak	And I would like to secure communication between app and proxy
2018-02-13 09:56:47	vegardx	Depends wether or not you need TLS from proxy->backend
2018-02-13 09:57:12	vegardx	Then you need $some certificate, something that you can either validate or ship with a certificate authortiy
2018-02-13 09:57:25	Papinak	Yes, I know

2018-02-13 12:01:44	jokke	i'm having some trouble with my nginx setup: i've set it up to receive http2 requests and they're proxied to a rails app. Now i've sometimes come across this bug, that nginx just hangs indefinetly on a request
2018-02-13 12:01:54	jokke	it doesn't hit the backend at all
2018-02-13 12:02:18	jokke	and in the end i see a 499 in the nginx log when the client decides it's had enough
2018-02-13 12:04:12	jokke	oh ok it's a backend issue
2018-02-13 12:04:29	jokke	i restarted the rails app and it works again
2018-02-13 12:04:42	jokke	heading to #ruby-on-rails to find out more

2018-02-13 13:13:39	mva	I just want to allow basic auth (by nginx, and not by backend), but not force it; So I added `satisfy any; allow all; auth_basic <...>;`

2018-02-13 13:15:03	mva	but since I only check $remote_user on backend for now, that configuration leads to the fact that nginx allow to "auth" with any password (and $remote_user contains the username irrelevant to correctness of the password)
2018-02-13 13:15:34	mva	(and I want to ignore username if password was invalid)
2018-02-13 13:15:51	benbrown	I was going to suggest checking if $remote_user was set on an unsuccessful auth attempt

2018-02-13 13:20:11	mva	benbrown: as I said, it sets even on unsuccessful auth attempt, so, yes it works in the way I don't expect. That's why I'm interested in the way to know if auth was successful or not
2018-02-13 13:20:34	mva	// or is it a bug, that NgX sets the variable on unsuccessful auth?..

2018-02-13 13:24:57	MTecknology	I wonder if the rate limit module would let me return 200 and convince the client their upload was a success...
2018-02-13 13:25:51	benbrown	MTecknology: I might be misunderstanding but can't your app return an error when there's more than 20 concurrent connections and nginx can then re-route to the other upstream(s)
2018-02-13 13:26:48	ren0v0	Hey, i'm trying to get nginx working with socketio, however having some issues with CORS. I've got this config  https://pastebin.com/vvSbhVfD  but receiving duplicated headers?
2018-02-13 13:27:13	ren0v0	I'm receiving Access-Control-Allow-Credentials + Access-Control-Allow-Origin twice, so the browser is blocking it
2018-02-13 13:28:08	MTecknology	the app is dumb as crap and is basically mystery code I don't want to voyage into. I can prove how bad their source is... I'm trying to find the easiest way to just wedge in some middleware to trash the messages. The thing you said about returning an error (I don't want that..)- I want clients thinking the upload was a success so that the damned things don't keep retrying.
2018-02-13 13:28:47	MTecknology	It beats the crap out of the infrastructure pretty hard until all the nodes have come back up and the data their sending basically loses all context during mass reconnects.

2018-02-13 16:24:29	benbrown	add the header with an empty value (e.g. "") then add it after with the value you want
2018-02-13 16:24:51	Bish	uhm.. wouldn't that make it appear 3 times?
2018-02-13 16:25:40	Bish	no, that works, thank you
2018-02-13 16:25:41	benbrown	I thought adding with an empty value would remove it but I must be thinking of something else
2018-02-13 16:25:45	Bish	that's really ugly, though
2018-02-13 16:25:47	benbrown	or maybe not
2018-02-13 16:25:56	benbrown	I think it depends where the header was added
2018-02-13 16:26:08	Bish	it's a content-type
2018-02-13 16:26:10	Bish	which is wrong
2018-02-13 16:26:17	Bish	it is set by nginx itself
2018-02-13 16:26:29	benbrown	I normally use default_type to change the content type
2018-02-13 16:26:42	Bish	can i do that for a location also?
2018-02-13 16:27:20	Bish	or is there.. "set_type" or similiar?
2018-02-13 16:27:23	Bish	for a single location
2018-02-13 16:27:26	benbrown	`default_type' - what's it say in context?

2018-02-13 16:27:45	Bish	octet thingie

2018-02-13 16:28:05	benbrown	I mean go to http://ngx.cc/r/default_type and look at what it says after "Context"
2018-02-13 16:28:47	Bish	ah i see, but changing it doesn't do anything for me
2018-02-13 16:28:53	Bish	since it doesn't use the default type there
2018-02-13 16:29:22	benbrown	you can also set `types' to be empty

2018-02-13 16:43:29	@ngxbot	Use `curl` for testing. Seriously. Check configs with `nginx -t`, then reload. Browser caching causes phantom issues. Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.

2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:22:47] hi, i want to use add_header
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:22:52] but i want it to replace the already existing one
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:22:59] how does one do that
2018-02-13 18:10:49	benbrown	[15:24:29] add the header with an empty value (e.g. "") then add it after with the value you want
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:24:51] uhm.. wouldn't that make it appear 3 times?
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:25:40] no, that works, thank you
2018-02-13 18:10:49	benbrown	[15:25:41] I thought adding with an empty value would remove it but I must be thinking of something else
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:25:45] that's really ugly, though
2018-02-13 18:10:49	benbrown	[15:25:47] or maybe not
2018-02-13 18:10:49	benbrown	[15:25:56] I think it depends where the header was added
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:26:08] it's a content-type
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:26:10] which is wrong
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:26:17] it is set by nginx itself
2018-02-13 18:10:49	benbrown	[15:26:29] I normally use default_type to change the content type
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:26:42] can i do that for a location also?
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:27:20] or is there.. "set_type" or similiar?
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:27:23] for a single location
2018-02-13 18:10:49	benbrown	[15:27:26] `default_type' - what's it say in context?
2018-02-13 18:10:49	@ngxbot	[15:27:26] http://ngx.cc/r/default_type
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:27:45] octet thingie
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:28:04] but it is not used
2018-02-13 18:10:49	benbrown	[15:28:05] I mean go to http://ngx.cc/r/default_type and look at what it says after "Context"
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:28:47] ah i see, but changing it doesn't do anything for me
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:28:53] since it doesn't use the default type there
2018-02-13 18:10:49	benbrown	[15:29:22] you can also set `types' to be empty
2018-02-13 18:10:49	@ngxbot	[15:29:22] http://ngx.cc/r/types
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:29:30] i tried that.. doesn't work :(
2018-02-13 18:10:49	benbrown	[15:29:47] I don't believe you
2018-02-13 18:10:49	benbrown	[15:29:52] !doesntwork
2018-02-13 18:10:49	@ngxbot	[15:29:52] "It doesn't work..." is a ridiculous statement. It conveys essentially no information whatsoever except the unfortunate. No one can help with such a statement. Provide actual information, such as what actually happens, what messages are displayed, what you expected to happen, what you see in logs, etc.; specifics! See !config to share your configuration with us. See !problem also.
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:30:26] well i am having (for that location)
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:30:41] types {};default_type 'application/json';return 200 '{}';
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:30:48] and it's image/png because of .png ending in the url
2018-02-13 18:10:49	benbrown	[15:31:29] ahh - I don't think it'll work with return
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:31:36] i see.
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:31:43] so you do believe me :p
2018-02-13 18:10:49	benbrown	[15:31:53] with context, yes ;)
2018-02-13 18:10:49	Bish	[15:34:23] so i won't have what i want?
2018-02-13 18:10:49	benbrown	[15:39:52] I've gone back to not believing you, because it works for me. The only difference is I've not quoted application/json
2018-02-13 18:10:49	@ngxbot	[15:41:24] Paste from benbrown: [ https://paste.ngx.cc/d9 ]
2018-02-13 18:10:49	benbrown	[15:41:45] Oh and I put a newline in the reply, but that shouldn't make any difference
2018-02-13 18:10:49	benbrown	[15:42:50] Yeah, I've removed the newline and it works as expected
2018-02-13 18:10:49	benbrown	[15:43:28] And tried with quotes around application/json so that's not causing it. Have you tried with `curl'?
2018-02-13 18:10:49	@ngxbot	[15:43:29] Use `curl` for testing. Seriously. Check configs with `nginx -t`, then reload. Browser caching causes phantom issues. Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.
2018-02-13 18:10:49	dking_desktop	[16:26:55] In the online documentation $host can come from the "request line", which is something different than the Host HTTP header field. What exactly is the "request line"?
2018-02-13 18:10:49	benbrown	[16:29:30] GET / HTTP/1.1 <-- that's an example request line, though it doesn't include the hostname
2018-02-13 18:10:49	benbrown	[16:29:52] See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-5.1
2018-02-13 18:10:49	dking_desktop	[16:30:17] Yeah, I thought that would be a strange place to find a hostname.
2018-02-13 18:10:49	benbrown	[16:31:25] It's unusual, but common in the case of proxies
2018-02-13 18:10:49	dking_desktop	[16:38:02] Okay. Thanks for the info!

2018-02-14 01:27:00	@ngxbot	Dragonkeeper: Use `curl` for testing. Seriously. Check configs with `nginx -t`, then reload. Browser caching causes phantom issues. Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.

2018-02-14 11:33:44	@ngxbot	Use `curl` for testing. Seriously. Check configs with `nginx -t`, then reload. Browser caching causes phantom issues. Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.

2018-02-14 15:22:09	vandemar	MacroMan: 1. test with `curl'.  2. enable debug-level error logs and read them, nginx will walk through exactly what it does, and you'll be able to confirm (or deny) that it's ignoring those rewrites, and why
2018-02-14 15:22:09	@ngxbot	Use `curl` for testing. Seriously. Check configs with `nginx -t`, then reload. Browser caching causes phantom issues. Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.

2018-02-14 21:39:55	@ngxbot	Help us help you with your *nginx* problem. Compose an *nginx* problem statement. A problem statement is a concise, accurate, thought-out, and mostly non-technical statement describing your nginx-related problem. What are you [really] trying to accomplish? Why? What do you expect to happen? What happens instead? What have you done to try to solve the problem? Compose your problem statement offline.

2018-02-14 21:40:24	@ngxbot	When nginx has selected a subset of server blocks (see !listen), nginx uses in order of preference 1. A server_name match; 2. A server block with listen ... default_server; 3. The first server block in parsing order, which becomes the default_server (this is bad! always label a default_server for each ip:port !)

2018-02-15 14:46:55	benbrown	Most people would bind it to 127.0.0.1, then anyone not on the server won't be able to get to it anyway
2018-02-15 14:47:19	benbrown	if you want to redirect it, then your app will have to do that, nginx doesn't even see that traffic
2018-02-15 14:47:50	Nerdmind	saitoh183: Oh, OK. Hmm. If the backend is on a dedicated server, you could configure the firewall on the dedicated server to only allow connections from the nginx frontend to that port?

2018-02-15 16:37:10	benbrown	don't tell me you're testing with a browser....
2018-02-15 16:37:14	benbrown	`curl'
2018-02-15 16:37:14	@ngxbot	Use `curl` for testing. Seriously. Check configs with `nginx -t`, then reload. Browser caching causes phantom issues. Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.

2018-02-15 17:11:00	benbrown	You using http2 to hit one static resource? That's not really agreat http2 use case
2018-02-15 17:11:12	gryzli	I wanted to just point it out

2018-02-15 17:12:05	gryzli	HTTP2 is not important in this
2018-02-15 17:12:21	gryzli	rather , the bad performance compared to Apache  , under SSL
2018-02-15 17:13:19	benbrown	I've not looked in to any ssl tuning, others in here might have, lurk around for a while.

2018-02-16 20:40:47	vandemar	[17:25:07] sj80: that doesn't make a lot of sense.  you're enabling ssl for port 80?
2018-02-16 20:40:47	MTecknology	[17:31:44] sj80: show us the curl request that proves your statement (in a pbin, of course)
2018-02-16 20:40:47	sj80	[17:50:48] thx jaybe, your are right. I found the problem.
2018-02-16 20:40:47	nicedreams	[17:51:06] Can you guys look at my generic config I use and see if it's okay or if anything I should modify?  I use this for general configuration when I first install nginx on debian for local www testing.  https://pastebin.com/V5HLNX2k
2018-02-16 20:40:47	nicedreams	[17:51:24] I don't host public sites, just do things locally while I learn.
2018-02-16 20:40:47	nicedreams	[17:51:47] but I put SSL in there for if I want to run a personal site on a VPS for myself.
2018-02-16 20:40:47	nicedreams	[17:52:00] and seems have to use https now anyways.
2018-02-16 20:40:47	MTecknology	[17:52:45] nicedreams: reading topics when you enter channels is typically considered good practice
2018-02-16 20:40:47	nicedreams	[17:53:14] so i can ask about http and not https?

2018-02-16 20:40:47	nicedreams	[17:54:06] I don't get the topic then?  I can't ask questions about nginx config?
2018-02-16 20:40:47	MTecknology	[17:54:09] don't use pastebin.com (ever)
2018-02-16 20:40:47	MTecknology	[17:54:23] Does the topic make that confusing?
2018-02-16 20:40:47	nicedreams	[17:54:30] seems everywhere says to use pastbin
2018-02-16 20:40:47	nicedreams	[17:55:45] nevermind then
2018-02-16 20:40:47	MTecknology	[17:59:21] nicedreams: If you'd bothered to follow one basic common-sense instruction, I'd have pointed you at !ssl. I'm sure you wouldn't have read anything in it, but it would at least have explained what was wrong.
2018-02-16 20:40:47	fission6	[18:14:10] if i need to annotate but need to filter on the query i should look to subquery right

2018-02-19 17:32:49	aruns	[12:08:03] Forgive me I am tired :P
2018-02-19 17:32:49	aruns	[12:08:10] Yeah I can see now.
2018-02-19 17:32:49	aruns	[12:08:13] Thanks.
2018-02-19 17:32:49	vandemar	[12:08:31] that's also not recommended, handling http and https in the same server block
2018-02-19 17:32:49	aruns	[12:08:58] It's only for my local.
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AnrDaemon	[12:11:03] Local or not, doing so is prone to serious misfires.
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AnrDaemon	[12:11:29] Also "normalization" of URL's like that is bad for many backends.
2018-02-19 17:32:49	aruns	[12:12:22] So you mean like for server_name, I should be using variables like $host instead?
2018-02-19 17:32:49	benbrown	[12:13:10] I don't know what you mean.
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AnrDaemon	[12:13:11] No.
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AnrDaemon	[12:13:23] That's an entirely unrelated setting.
2018-02-19 17:32:49	aruns	[12:13:53] Oh, right, you just mean the URL naming convention we have in place?
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AnrDaemon	[12:14:30] For example.
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AnrDaemon	[12:15:15] If your *application* wants these addresses normalized, it should do that by itself.
2018-02-19 17:32:49	aruns	[12:20:03] Alright, thanks, I will bear that in mind.

2018-02-19 17:32:49	vandemar	[12:23:26] oops, I forgot to remove the listen 80 from the second server block
2018-02-19 17:32:49	benbrown	[12:24:07] if you *really* have to do a rewrite outside of a location like that, then put it before the locations. It's easier to see what's going on then
2018-02-19 17:32:49	benbrown	[12:24:27] but like others have said, nginx doesn't seem to be the right place for rewrites like this

2018-02-19 17:32:49	illsci	[14:03:04] Is there a better way to do this https://paste.ngx.cc/93 than using if?
2018-02-19 17:32:49	illsci	[14:03:38] I want to change the content type only if the x_amz_sns_message_type header exists and is SubscriptionConfirmation or Notification
2018-02-19 17:32:49	benbrown	[14:18:00] If you set the default to "" then you could get rid of the if
2018-02-19 17:32:49	benbrown	[14:18:36] add_header with a blank value won't actually add the header IIRC, so the normal content-type should get used. Test it first obviously ;)

2018-02-19 17:32:49	saturnU	[15:37:12] grep -nr 'nginx.conf' . <- this one in nginx director
2018-02-19 17:32:49	tsenko	[15:37:13] .. it's neither of those under /etc
2018-02-19 17:32:49	tsenko	[15:38:03] well which directory is it
2018-02-19 17:32:49	tsenko	[15:38:10] where the executable is ?
2018-02-19 17:32:49	alanhuang	[15:38:37] have you tried nginx -T
2018-02-19 17:32:49	vegardx	[15:38:39] You're asking very general question. How did you build it? There's your answer.
2018-02-19 17:32:49	alanhuang	[15:38:41] that dumps the whole config
2018-02-19 17:32:49	tsenko	[15:39:04] i'm running cygwin .. it came prebuilt from the repositories
2018-02-19 17:32:49	vegardx	[15:39:22] I think most people in here run Linux, so good luck!
2018-02-19 17:32:49	vegardx	[15:39:23] :)
2018-02-19 17:32:49	benbrown	[15:39:34] If it's recent enough alanhuang's suggestion should work fine, but windows so YMMV
2018-02-19 17:32:49	tsenko	[15:40:17] oh... alanhuang thank you ... it's the first line
2018-02-19 17:32:49	tsenko	[15:40:24] buddha bless you mister alanhuang

2018-02-20 17:17:31	DevAntoine	[08:40:33] is there a proper way to override the default document root without editing nginx.conf?
2018-02-20 17:17:31	vegardx	[08:41:21] You set it where you need to set it?
2018-02-20 17:17:31	DevAntoine	[08:41:45] vegardx: sorry?
2018-02-20 17:17:31	vegardx	[08:41:45] In general you shouldn't set it outside of server-context
2018-02-20 17:17:31	DevAntoine	[08:42:10] vegardx: well, default document root is set to /usr/share/nginx/html
2018-02-20 17:17:31	DevAntoine	[08:42:16] I want to put it in /var/www/html
2018-02-20 17:17:31	DevAntoine	[08:42:25] but I don't want to edit the default conf
2018-02-20 17:17:31	vegardx	[08:42:37] So set it in the appropriate server block?
2018-02-20 17:17:31	vegardx	[08:44:41] server { root /foo/bar; }
2018-02-20 17:17:31	DevAntoine	[10:37:28] vegardx: so I just add a server block/j #redhat

2018-02-20 17:17:31	vandemar	[13:59:12] alexises: why?  just get a valid cert.
2018-02-20 17:17:31	alexises	[14:02:00] vandemar: can't, it's a specific usecase for old device that rely on hard coded CA that use md5
2018-02-20 17:17:31	alexises	[14:02:45] defintively if I could avoid it, I'll do ;)
2018-02-20 17:17:31	vandemar	[14:03:43] any such device that old is probably doing things that render ssl insecure anyway
2018-02-20 17:17:31	vandemar	[14:06:45] it looks like there's an environment variable that'll do it, if you haven't discovered that already.
2018-02-20 17:17:31	alexises	[14:14:35] vandemar: I just search this secret var ^^

2018-02-20 18:23:27	vegardx	[08:41:45] In general you shouldn't set it outside of server-context
2018-02-20 18:23:27	DevAntoine	[08:42:10] vegardx: well, default document root is set to /usr/share/nginx/html
2018-02-20 18:23:27	DevAntoine	[08:42:16] I want to put it in /var/www/html
2018-02-20 18:23:27	DevAntoine	[08:42:25] but I don't want to edit the default conf
2018-02-20 18:23:27	vegardx	[08:42:37] So set it in the appropriate server block?
2018-02-20 18:23:27	vegardx	[08:44:41] server { root /foo/bar; }
2018-02-20 18:23:27	DevAntoine	[10:37:28] vegardx: so I just add a server block/j #redhat

2018-02-20 18:23:27	benbrown	[11:21:40] or don't put it in the webroot in the first place....
2018-02-20 18:23:27	benbrown	[11:22:15] Also if you are using any regex locations, then use location ^~ /system instead of just /system

2018-02-20 18:23:27	Peng_	[13:34:33] That's probably more an OpenSSL question. Ew.
2018-02-20 18:23:27	vandemar	[13:59:12] alexises: why?  just get a valid cert.
2018-02-20 18:23:27	alexises	[14:02:00] vandemar: can't, it's a specific usecase for old device that rely on hard coded CA that use md5
2018-02-20 18:23:27	alexises	[14:02:45] defintively if I could avoid it, I'll do ;)
2018-02-20 18:23:27	vandemar	[14:03:43] any such device that old is probably doing things that render ssl insecure anyway
2018-02-20 18:23:27	vandemar	[14:06:45] it looks like there's an environment variable that'll do it, if you haven't discovered that already.
2018-02-20 18:23:27	alexises	[14:14:35] vandemar: I just search this secret var ^^

2018-02-20 20:59:55	teward	Soltis: when the requested host matches the server block.  We'd need to know details about the request in question as well as the server configurations to really answer that.

2018-02-20 21:06:51	Soltis	At worst, it's a no-op.
2018-02-20 21:07:03	jaybe	so you understand that the underscore means nothing in this context then; lgood
2018-02-20 21:07:03	Soltis	It also shouldn't (in any sane world) override a default_server directive.

2018-02-20 21:16:10	jaybe	Soltis, correct- as stated. underscore is meaningless, aside from being an underscore, in this context
2018-02-20 21:16:52	jaybe	an explicit server_name match- ... will match. and beat out default_server, or otherwise
2018-02-20 21:17:13	Soltis	jaybe: I know that, except there is nothing in the config that remotely matches the domain name of the request.
2018-02-20 21:17:29	Soltis	jaybe: For fun, I mapped bad-domain.com to the server IP in my hosts file and hit it, expecting the 444 response to take place.
2018-02-20 21:17:33	Soltis	Instead, I got the redirect.
2018-02-20 21:17:35	jaybe	Soltis, will you please take a moment to summarize your problem statement again - anew?

2018-02-20 21:19:38	AnrDaemon	In my case, a similar issue was resolved by adding .conf to sites-enabled/default
2018-02-20 21:20:02	AnrDaemon	\o/ for nginx -T showing the file wasn't even included in first place.
2018-02-20 21:20:05	jaybe	shrug; awaiting the problem statement and detail
2018-02-20 21:20:17	Soltis	That question is the entirety of what I want to know.
2018-02-20 21:21:01	AnrDaemon	So, provide nginx -T as requested. Or at least read it youerself first. That may be all that needed for solution.
2018-02-20 21:21:06	Soltis	Two blocks, one is non-default, one is default. One has a server_name that only matches two very specific domains, one is a catch-all. Why would the former of the two be the one that matches?
2018-02-20 21:21:36	Soltis	I had to go as far as mapping a junk domain in my hosts file simply to get the weird behaviour, so this is a largely theoretical exercise
2018-02-20 21:21:51	AnrDaemon	!curl | Soltis
2018-02-20 21:21:52	@ngxbot	Soltis: Use `curl` for testing. Seriously. Check configs with `nginx -t`, then reload. Browser caching causes phantom issues. Disabling/clearing browser caches is mistake-prone. `curl -I example.com` is a common pattern, fetches fresh headers (-i for headers+content) including `location` redirects. `curl -v ...` even shows http2 (h2) and ALPN negotiation. Test redirect urls hop by hop.
2018-02-20 21:21:52	jaybe	Soltis, thanks; so you're stating that you have a domain that is dns-pointed at your server' IP address. you're further saying that visiting that domain and IP address is served the 'wrong' nginx config?
2018-02-20 21:22:10	jaybe	you *are* testing with curl.. right?
2018-02-20 21:22:12	teward	Soltis: how are you testing?  Your web browser?
2018-02-20 21:22:13	teward	or curl?
2018-02-20 21:22:22	teward	if your web browser, you need to NUKE the browser cache each attempt
2018-02-20 21:22:26	teward	curl has no cache, and is the better testbed
2018-02-20 21:23:10	Soltis	jaybe: Per the response I get and the nginx server log, yes. Also with curl AND the browser, since I like to be redundant with testing.
2018-02-20 21:23:37	Soltis	jaybe: I have the logs tagged with the server name, so I know which one it matched from that alone.

2018-02-20 21:27:05	AnrDaemon	Soltis: If you are free to alter server config in any way you want, a simple blanket `return 200 "I'm $server_name";` can help while you debug your issues. At least it will save you a roundtrip to the logs.
2018-02-20 21:27:37	Soltis	AFAIK, server blocks are filtered first by listening directives, then by server name (exact -> shortest wildcard -> catch-all) with default_server being the tie-breaker in the final case.

2018-02-20 21:35:16	jaybe	unless you KNOW that nginx doesnt do something obvious like logging a restart- dont exclaim and promote it
2018-02-20 21:35:28	vandemar	init scripts / systemd.  you just have to make sure it actually works, which means not installing nginx from source and not installing conflicting packages
2018-02-20 21:35:45	jaybe	by a working and valid init script and your distributions control method.
2018-02-20 21:35:57	jaybe	systemd typically
2018-02-20 21:36:00	vandemar	if you start monkeying around with packages or installing from source, or using 3rd party packages, it's on you to figure it out
2018-02-20 21:36:12	Soltis	vandemar: I installed it from the Ubuntu repo; it's the init scripts from that which I'm using.
2018-02-20 21:36:24	jaybe	how are you restarting or reloading the Web server?
2018-02-20 21:37:28	Soltis	Generally `service nginx restart`
2018-02-20 21:38:22	jaybe	sounds deprecated
2018-02-20 21:38:29	jaybe	following doxumentation?
2018-02-20 21:39:18	Soltis	jaybe: Possibly out of date docs. Pisses me off that apparently breaking command line compat is a hobby these days; I read how to manage it when I first started using it ages ago.
2018-02-20 21:39:51	jaybe	In fairness that command should still work however system D has replaced the approach to managing
2018-02-20 21:40:08	Soltis	Yeah, so now it's systemctl restart nginx

2018-02-20 21:41:38	jdewald	unless you have issues in your config, I don't think you'll see anything in error.log during startup

2018-02-20 21:41:44	jaybe	Soltis, hmm i may stand corrected
2018-02-20 21:41:54	AnrDaemon	jaybe: service is a common wrapper for all init systems.
2018-02-20 21:41:56	jaybe	Nerdmind, i know; thanks anyway. was using dictation

2018-02-20 21:42:43	AnrDaemon	jaybe: And in systemd, it is always using systemctl AFAIK, since systemd creates wrappers for init.d services at runtime.
2018-02-20 21:42:47	jdewald	that should show something like "Nginx reverse proxy..."
2018-02-20 21:43:13	Soltis	jdewald: Yes, I know how to check status, but except for looking at the runtime, there's no way to know (i.e. from logs) when the server actually was restarted last.
2018-02-20 21:43:21	jaybe	i just tested the restart thing - and i stand corrected. i could tell it restarted but only because of a startup shared memory notice i recognize. this must have changed
2018-02-20 21:43:36	jdewald	But the systemd logs should contain that information
2018-02-20 21:43:38	jaybe	Soltis, apologies for misleading
2018-02-20 21:43:40	Soltis	jaybe: Yeah. I'd gotten used to no message, so I didn't have feedback that the config wasn't in use.

2018-02-20 21:45:27	Soltis	I guess nginx -s reload might be the best option overall
2018-02-20 21:45:34	Soltis	When I just want to rescrape configs
2018-02-20 21:45:42	Soltis	Or are there caveats there?
2018-02-20 21:45:49	jdewald	definitely use reload when you can
2018-02-20 21:46:07	jdewald	Caveats there are... it can be even more mysterious if it fails without checking logs
2018-02-20 21:46:24	Soltis	"fails" meaning bad config, or something else?
2018-02-20 21:46:27	jdewald	because systemctl reload nginx will actually succeed even if the new startup failed (and so your'e using old config)
2018-02-20 21:46:28	jdewald	yeah
2018-02-20 21:46:37	Soltis	I do nginx -T as a finger macro before restarting
2018-02-20 21:46:39	jdewald	But those would definitely be in the error.log
2018-02-20 21:47:01	thresh	its better to just send a signal, than havin nginx to read the whole conf8g during -s reload
2018-02-20 21:47:29	jaybe	eg. nginx -s reload   ?
2018-02-20 21:47:42	thresh	no, kill -HUP to the pid

2018-02-20 21:48:15	jaybe	kissing is more foreplay
2018-02-20 21:48:20	jdewald	doing -HUP doesn't get the the obvious config check
2018-02-20 21:48:20	jaybe	point?
2018-02-20 21:48:28	thresh	jdewald, of course it does
2018-02-20 21:48:28	Soltis	jaybe: I enjoy kissing more than typing.
2018-02-20 21:48:37	jaybe	fair
2018-02-20 21:48:46	thresh	after the signal is sent, nginx will try to load the config, and that involves checking it
2018-02-20 21:49:02	jdewald	right, but I don't think that happens "synchronously" will the HUP signal does it?

2018-02-20 21:52:18	jaybe	point is- you want reload/restart AND a config check
2018-02-20 21:52:23	thresh	iirc nginx -s reload was made because windows has no concept of signals

2018-02-20 22:50:39	hammer065	Since any other .baz file in any other folder works perfectly
2018-02-20 22:51:26	jdewald	yeah that seems curious, but perhaps this is specifics of how setting `index` with `root` works
2018-02-20 22:51:39	jdewald	you could try moving the root/index into the location block(s) where it applies

2018-02-23 00:14:22	ijnbui	[18:32:50] is there anywhere of list which directives are inherited and which aren't?

2018-02-23 00:14:22	AnrDaemon	[18:36:19] ijnbui: If a directive is not inherited, it explicitly mentions that.

2018-02-23 00:14:22	kj	[19:32:44] I'm currently using gcc 5.3 (rhel devtoolset) to build nginx rpm. Is there any advantage to use a more recent version such as 6.3 or 7.2?
2018-02-23 00:14:22	AnrDaemon	[19:49:00] kj: Is there any advantage to building nginx yourself?
2018-02-23 00:14:22	kj	[19:50:08] yes, make it easy to deploy nginx with custom modules on my servers
2018-02-23 00:14:22	kj	[19:54:53] it's easy for me to switch for a more recent gcc with mock so I was wondering if it's worth it
2018-02-23 00:14:22	ilken14	[19:55:38] q
2018-02-23 00:14:22	diverdude	[20:22:24] I am trying to restart my nginx serv but i get failure. when i look in status i see this line: eb 22 14:17:17 localhost.localdomain nginx[32092]: nginx: [emerg] BIO_new_file("/srv/jupyterhub/jupyterhub.crt") failed (SSL: error:0200100D:system library:fopen:Permission denied:fopen('/srv/jupyterhub/jupyterhub.crt','r') error:2006D002:BIO routines:BIO_new_file:system lib)   Why do i get this?
2018-02-23 00:14:22	Peng_	[20:23:37] It says why
2018-02-23 00:14:22	diverdude	[20:24:04] Peng_: but is it because its wrong owner or wrong permissions or what?
2018-02-23 00:14:22	diverdude	[20:24:39] that file has these permissions: -rw-r--r--   and has owner: root:root
2018-02-23 00:14:22	Peng_	[20:26:36] Hard to say. Does "namei -l /srv/jupyterhub/jupyterhub.crt" show reasonable permissions on the parents?
2018-02-23 00:14:22	Peng_	[20:26:50] Nginx should usually be started as root, so the permissions shouldn't matter.
2018-02-23 00:14:22	Peng_	[20:27:08] Anything in the AppArmor or SELinux logs?
2018-02-23 00:14:22	diverdude	[20:33:44] Peng_: hmm i disabled firewall and i tried to chmod that file to 777 but still gives same error
2018-02-23 00:14:22	diverdude	[20:34:11] Peng_: how to see AppArmor and SELinux logs?
2018-02-23 00:14:22	Peng_	[20:51:16] You shouldn't disable your firewall or chmod random things to 777.
2018-02-23 00:14:22	Peng_	[20:51:21] Not sure, probably in syslog.
2018-02-23 00:14:22	AnrDaemon	[21:31:52] wat
2018-02-23 00:14:22	groundup	[21:41:10] How would I rewrite this to nginx conf?

2018-02-23 00:14:22	groundup	[22:00:15] I've tried a lot of versions of this with rewrite and try_files. I just can't get it to work.
2018-02-23 00:14:22	bratchley	[22:44:03] jdewald: so if it's the "HTTP response" does that include the HTTP response headers?
2018-02-23 00:14:22	jdewald	[22:44:30] yeah
2018-02-23 00:14:22	jdewald	[22:44:59] for all intents and purposes, it's just a dump of the raw data that comes back
2018-02-23 00:14:22	jdewald	[22:45:07] headers\r\n\r\nbody
2018-02-23 00:14:22	bratchley	[22:46:24] Are they encoded in some sort of way? Basically when I open the file all I see is the HTML of the response.
2018-02-23 00:14:22	jdewald	[22:47:03] depends on your definition of "enhanced". It has a header with the cache key and I think the ttl. Other than that, I don't think so
2018-02-23 00:14:22	bratchley	[22:47:53] Like I see the "Content-Type" header but I know my web pages are sending more than just that
2018-02-23 00:14:22	jdewald	[22:49:11] are you able to confirm that independently?
2018-02-23 00:14:22	bratchley	[22:49:36] yeah I can see the response headers in chrome and I'm looking at the cache file in vim
2018-02-23 00:14:22	jdewald	[22:50:11] but what Chrome is getting is the response from nginx, not your origin
2018-02-23 00:14:22	bratchley	[22:51:24] yeah but I can see some stuff like PHP version in there because I haven't turned off expose_php yet
2018-02-23 00:14:22	bratchley	[22:54:20] actually I think I lied to you
2018-02-23 00:14:22	bratchley	[22:54:24] you're right
2018-02-23 00:14:22	bratchley	[22:54:42] I thought I hadn't but I just re-checked and it isn't there, the only stuff in there is nginx-related stuff
2018-02-23 00:14:22	bratchley	[22:54:49] ok it makes sense now, sorry about that
2018-02-23 00:14:22	jdewald	[22:54:53] no worries
2018-02-23 00:14:22	bratchley	[22:56:14] and if I turn it back on and regen cache it's in the cache file. I feel like a doofus now geez
2018-02-23 00:14:22	jdewald	[22:57:12] eh, that's how we learn

2018-02-24 22:45:50	@ngxbot	[18:27:29] We need more configuration details to help you further. Please provide your *entire* server configuration(s) to OUR pastebin (only) at http://p.ngx.cc/. `nginx -T` w/ nginx 1.10+. Remember to include any `include` files.

2018-02-24 22:45:50	MTecknology	[18:28:16] and.. ya know... actually share the curl command and output, instead of just saying it doesn't work.
2018-02-24 22:45:50	sadtaco	[18:30:43] I did give the output of it.
2018-02-24 22:45:50	 *	MTecknology [18:31:17] sighs
2018-02-24 22:45:50	sadtaco	[18:32:21] There's a pastebin and what I originally said with the domains. I don't know why you're being so obtuse.
2018-02-24 22:45:50	MTecknology	[18:32:35] because you're being a fucking moron
2018-02-24 22:45:50	MTecknology	[18:32:43] Read the shit you've been told.
2018-02-24 22:45:50	sadtaco	[18:33:14] You mean telling me to give the error I already gave? lol
2018-02-24 22:45:50	MTecknology	[18:34:00] enjoy your virtual sex bro... good luck finding a clue
2018-02-24 22:45:50	 *	MTecknology [18:34:06] is done
2018-02-24 22:45:50	sadtaco	[18:35:59] You never started.
2018-02-24 22:45:50	MTecknology	[18:37:08] Either provide the information you were asked, or you do not need to be here.
2018-02-24 22:45:50	sadtaco	[18:37:12] Real mature. You kick people who point out that you don't read.
2018-02-24 22:45:50	sadtaco	[18:37:13] I DID
2018-02-24 22:45:50	MTecknology	[18:37:29] If that's how you feel, then you do not need to be here.
2018-02-24 22:45:50	sadtaco	[18:37:34] I used curl and it gave the same error I already told you from remote and I pasted it anyway.
2018-02-24 22:45:50	sadtaco	[18:37:50] Does "curl: (51) SSL: no alternative certificate subject name matches target host name " not look like a curl error to you?
2018-02-24 22:45:50	MTecknology	[18:38:05] OMG! you provided almost 1/4th of what you were asked!
2018-02-24 22:45:50	sadtaco	[18:40:17] I already gave the config in pastebin. There's no errors in the nginx error.log. I get a 403 with no errors relating to it when I "add exception", like I already said. The http domain serves the expected files, and it's https that gives a 403 but that's with an exception added.  Only thing I haven't provided that you asked is the entire config. That's one thing, not 3/4ths.
2018-02-24 22:45:50	jaybe	[18:46:05] arguing with channel regulars and yipping back at some giving you their time to help you ftw
2018-02-24 22:45:50	MTecknology	[18:50:31] doncha know, if you argue enough, it magically makes missing information exist?
2018-02-24 22:45:50	bratchley	[18:51:44] just looking at the config though, is the double period on the ssl_certificate intentional
2018-02-24 22:45:50	MTecknology	[18:51:54] it's a find/replace mistake
2018-02-24 22:45:50	bratchley	[18:51:55] actually I probably should talk to someone +q'd so nevermind
2018-02-24 22:45:50	bratchley	[18:52:18] yeah
2018-02-24 22:45:50	MTecknology	[18:52:28] I sure a majority of that config is inaccurate
2018-02-24 22:45:50	MTecknology	[19:06:37] sadtaco: If you want the quiet removed, then you can provide a pbin of your actual config and the curl command you ran and the output of curl -I.  If you don't want help, then don't provide one and we're kinda already set.
2018-02-24 22:45:50	MTecknology	[19:07:26] I don't care is you s/rphaven.com/example.com/, but we need the actual config you're dealing with.
2018-02-24 22:45:50	kanav	[21:25:29] hi
2018-02-24 22:45:50	kanav	[21:25:54] i am trying to install nginx
2018-02-24 22:45:50	kanav	[21:26:44] it is installed but when i run this command "sudo ufw app list"
2018-02-24 22:45:50	kanav	[21:27:09] it shows "sudo: ufw: command not found"
2018-02-24 22:45:50	vandemar	[21:27:13] this is not a ubuntu help channel.
2018-02-24 22:45:51	MTecknology	[21:28:22] vandemar: I laughed at that ubuntu assumption. :)
2018-02-24 22:45:51	MTecknology	[21:28:54] mostly because it's a pretty safe bet..
2018-02-24 22:45:51	kanav	[21:29:45] so what i have to do for run this command @MTecknology
2018-02-24 22:45:51	vandemar	[21:30:11] you don't have to run it.  it has nothing to do with nginx config or serving webpages.  it has everything to do with system administration and network security, which are beyond the scope of this channel
2018-02-24 22:45:51	kanav	[21:30:28] ok thanks
2018-02-24 22:45:51	MTecknology	[21:31:54] that, and ufw is basically garbage (except when compared to rhel's default)
2018-02-24 22:45:51	kanav	[21:32:27] I am following this page to install nginx https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-16-04
2018-02-24 22:45:51	MTecknology	[21:32:51] don't...
2018-02-24 22:45:51	kanav	[21:32:51] that's why i raised this question here
2018-02-24 22:45:51	MTecknology	[21:32:54] "apt-get install nginx"
2018-02-24 22:45:51	Peng_	[21:33:26] kanav: The question isn't at all about Nginx, though.
2018-02-24 22:45:51	MTecknology	[21:33:36] any guide that starts off by telling you to compile the software you're interested in as a beginner task should be discarded.
2018-02-24 22:45:51	vandemar	[21:36:13] it does?
2018-02-24 22:45:51	vandemar	[21:37:53] I'm mostly concerned that you're running a server without understanding the intent (or how to install) a simple firewall utility command
2018-02-24 22:45:51	MTecknology	[21:38:57] Oh, wow... that one doesn't.
2018-02-24 22:45:51	MTecknology	[21:40:06] Most of the DO/Linode guides start off with compiling the one piece of software, followed by repo installation of the rest. (most--all, until now--of the DO-nginx guides I've seen do the same)

2018-02-24 23:57:21	MTecknology	dear god...
2018-02-24 23:57:22	^Mike	btw, your pastebin doesn't accept valid IRC nicks
2018-02-24 23:57:41	MTecknology	I almost want to hug you.
2018-02-24 23:57:52	^Mike	ok but why

2018-02-24 23:58:11	MTecknology	I asked you to provide information and you did.
2018-02-24 23:58:52	^Mike	the most relevant part is probably the http2 options on the listen lines at 272
2018-02-24 23:59:31	MTecknology	your map could use a 'default 0;', so you could do if ($new_uri) { ... }
2018-02-24 23:59:54	^Mike	I only know some of those words
2018-02-25 00:00:29	MTecknology	How much do you understand the config you shared?
2018-02-25 00:00:52	^Mike	well, I did write it all, but that was years ago, and I haven't done anything serious with nginx since then
2018-02-25 00:01:22	MTecknology	You have a map, it should have a default so you can simplify the rest of your logic.

2018-02-25 00:18:54	^Mike	so, I guess the requests are getting processed ok, but contain something that causes Chrome to barf? (how is that even possible?) or nginx is sending the reply for stuff served by php in a way that causes chrome to barf (also how?)

2018-02-27 09:14:27	RawphullCawpter	[05:49:59] I've got a few entries in my error log that seem kind of suspicious, not sure if I've got a problem.
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RawphullCawpter	[05:51:01] One is "2018/02/26 21:48:55 [error] 765#765: *26823 open() "/usr/share/nginx/html/phpmyadmin/scripts/setup.php" failed (2: No such file or directory), client: 80.82.64.70, server: localhost, request: "GET //phpmyadmin/scripts/setup.php HTTP/1.1", host: "<my server ip>"
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RawphullCawpter	[05:52:20] DNS reverse lookup says the client IP is either mail.hotfreemail.com or mail.niftyemails.com
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RawphullCawpter	[05:53:03] I don't like the fact that it's accessing the server from "localhost", but that's confusing since the client is definitely a remote IP.
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RawphullCawpter	[05:54:05] It seems to be scanning for a bunch of setup.php scripts. phpmyadmin, pma, myadmin, etc. It sounds like I might have some overly permissive directives in my nginx.conf, maybe? It's not looking in any of the spots I host my services from, so that's a bit odd
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RawphullCawpter	[05:56:53] Looking at my .conf, I do have a server entry for localhost, but all it is is listen 80, server_name localhost, a location to the root they're trying to find these setup.php's in, and error_page with location
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RawphullCawpter	[05:57:21] I didn't think much of disabling it because, well, it's localhost, theoretically nobody should be able to even access it, but clearly something's going on
2018-02-27 09:14:27	thresh	[07:15:15] RawphullCawpter, if you listen on 80, it will listen on all ip addresses
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RawphullCawpter	[07:20:48] thresh, so a server for localhost set to listen on 80 acts as a catchall?
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RawphullCawpter	[07:21:40] basically, anything not defined elsewhere that makes it to the server is caught by the localhost listening on 80?
2018-02-27 09:14:27	thresh	[07:23:42] RawphullCawpter, no, it's not a property of server_name;  I guess your localhost block is the first one for that ip:port pair (:80), so it's chosen as a default one if other are not matched
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RawphullCawpter	[07:24:55] thresh, I commented that block out, so that shouldn't happen anymore, right? There's nothing there for them to find, but I still don't much like it
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RawphullCawpter	[07:25:40] Oh, wait, I think I understand. If nothing matches at all, it defaults to the first block
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RawphullCawpter	[07:25:58] So now it'll just default to the next block assuming they try something that doesn't match anything at all
2018-02-27 09:14:27	nwe	[07:27:57] hello I trying to use something like this https://pastebin.com/a1ksKK7F the synatx is OK and when I reloading the server an trying to reach it I cant..
2018-02-27 09:14:27	thresh	[07:28:44] RawphullCawpter, yes
2018-02-27 09:14:27	thresh	[07:29:05] RawphullCawpter, read http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/server_names.html and http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/request_processing.html
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RawphullCawpter	[07:40:11] thresh, that helps a lot. Thank you!
2018-02-27 09:14:27	ren0v0	[07:59:36] Hi, i've been using this config for ages and it was working fine, to block bad referers.  https://pastebin.com/Wrt7NHC6
2018-02-27 09:14:27	ren0v0	[07:59:48] However, now all of their requests are getting 200s, any idea what's wrong?
2018-02-27 09:14:27	SmokedCheese	[08:10:15] ren0v0: looks fine
2018-02-27 09:14:27	ren0v0	[08:10:24] SmokedCheese, i know, i've not changed it...
2018-02-27 09:14:27	SmokedCheese	[08:11:00] you can try referer module https://nginx.ru/en/docs/http/ngx_http_referer_module.html
2018-02-27 09:14:27	ren0v0	[08:11:03] 187.36.200.5 - - [27/Feb/2018:08:10:37 +0000] "GET /request HTTP/1.1" 200 158 "-" "https://domain.com" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/64.0.3282.186 Safari/537.36"
2018-02-27 09:14:27	ren0v0	[08:11:06] but look
2018-02-27 09:14:27	SmokedCheese	[08:11:42] and what's value for $bad_referer?
2018-02-27 09:14:27	ren0v0	[08:11:56] "~domain.com"    1;
2018-02-27 09:14:27	ren0v0	[08:12:40] like from my paste, i tried without wildcard also (added that to test)
2018-02-27 09:14:27	SmokedCheese	[08:12:46] maybe there's some other problem
2018-02-27 09:14:27	SmokedCheese	[08:12:58] like another server block is used
2018-02-27 09:14:27	SmokedCheese	[08:13:01] !config

2018-02-27 09:14:27	ren0v0	[08:13:12] I thought that, but this is root, and there is no other matching block

2018-02-27 12:01:52	benbrown	does your backend know it's at /magic? I suspect not, see `subdir'
2018-02-27 12:01:52	@ngxbot	A webapp in a subdirectory (eg //site/app/approute) is tricky if it's not your app, the app expects paths to be /approute instead of /app/approute, and you can't use hardcoding or send custom headers to tell the app its /app path prefix. Solutions: use subdomains instead of subdirs, or keep the request path unchanged for the backend.
2018-02-27 12:02:26	benbrown	Although one thing you could try is changing `proxy_pass              http://localhost:5000;` on line 44 to `proxy_pass              http://localhost:5000/;`
2018-02-27 12:02:28	franz__	subdomains would be the way to go I guess

2018-02-27 12:03:13	franz__	I can, I just found it more logical for me to have my vps as vps.domain.de and the apps as vps.domain.de/ | vps.domain.de/magic

2018-02-27 12:05:04	franz__	haha well adding the / to the proxy_pass on line 44 has it fixed 40% @benbrown :D I get to the app, but most .js and .css files could not be loaded
2018-02-27 12:05:24	franz__	404, so paths aren't correct for those
2018-02-27 12:06:52	franz__	Links on this 40% loaded site are also not correct. directing me to vps.domain.de/*link* instead of vps.domain.de/magic/*link* which would point to the :5000 localhost application
2018-02-27 12:07:33	franz__	do you have any suggestions on how to change my .conf to fix this?
2018-02-27 12:11:30	benbrown	Whatever's running on :5000 needs to know it's at /magic and not /
2018-02-27 12:11:54	benbrown	It's not an nginx thing, if you're lucky it'll have a sensible way of configuring that
2018-02-27 12:15:22	franz__	I will just switch over to magic.domain.de for that
2018-02-27 12:15:28	franz__	not worth the effort I guess
2018-02-27 12:17:44	franz__	so instead of another location, I'd add another server to the conf?
2018-02-27 12:18:09	benbrown	Yeah
2018-02-27 12:19:02	franz__	Would it be okay for you to be here for some minutes? Just so that I have someone to ask. I'd really appreciate
2018-02-27 12:20:36	benbrown	I'm at work so can't guarantee it, but generally I have half an eye out on here
2018-02-27 12:23:58	franz__	Thanks again, subdomain instantly worked^^

2018-03-10 17:39:48	bz-	[04:06:43] hi, i have nginx running a prod angular 5 app, and i have some routes in angular 5 that resolve to basically www.blah.com/asdf/123. when i take this url and just paste it into the web browser, i get a 404 from nginx. i should mention i am using https....(ssl)
2018-03-10 17:39:48	bz-	[04:06:48] is there anyway to resolve this?
2018-03-10 17:39:48	Membear	[04:18:29] yeah, by configuring a location to do what you want
2018-03-10 17:39:48	Membear	[04:18:29] what do you want
2018-03-10 17:39:48	bz-	[04:20:08] well, i mean, the route works fine. but if i do a hard refresh, it goes to a 404
2018-03-10 17:39:48	bz-	[04:20:16] it's just abc.com/x/y/z
2018-03-10 17:39:48	bz-	[04:20:20] x/y/z being a route
2018-03-10 17:39:48	bz-	[04:20:29] if i do a hard refresh, nginx gives a 404....
2018-03-10 17:39:48	Membear	[04:21:10] is your app just updating the address bar to a fake url?
2018-03-10 17:39:48	Membear	[04:21:22] what specifically do you want nginx to do
2018-03-10 17:39:48	bz-	[04:21:41] well, first, i am not sure why nginx is giving a 404
2018-03-10 17:39:48	bz-	[04:21:58] it's a single page application, that programatically loads resources based on the URL location
2018-03-10 17:39:48	bz-	[04:22:24] in this case, if i do a refresh at a particular URL, nginx just gives a 404, not sure what the issue is...
2018-03-10 17:39:48	Membear	[04:22:51] what specifically do you want nginx to do
2018-03-10 17:39:48	bz-	[04:23:11] not to give a 404
2018-03-10 17:39:48	bz-	[04:23:11] heh
2018-03-10 17:39:48	bz-	[04:23:16] not sure what the root issue is
2018-03-10 17:39:48	bz-	[05:11:47] issue resolved..programatically.

2018-03-10 17:39:48	gloomy	[12:29:11] Hi :)
2018-03-10 17:39:48	gloomy	[12:30:33] I'm very new to nginx. I want my webserver to serve a node (express) app, the right way is to setup nginx as a reverse proxy and direct requests to the node server, right ?
2018-03-10 17:39:48	gloomy	[12:32:59] The node server is up and listening on port 8080, locally I can do curl 127.0.0.1:8080 and I get my page
2018-03-10 17:39:48	gloomy	[12:33:44] but when I try to access it from my other machine, I get either a 404 with the IP address or a 502(bad gateway) with the domain name
2018-03-10 17:39:48	vandemar	[12:35:23] gloomy: yes, you'd reverse proxy to node.  check the error logs for 404 or 502 reasons.
2018-03-10 17:39:48	@ngxbot	[12:35:28] Paste from gloomy: [ https://paste.ngx.cc/3f ]
2018-03-10 17:39:48	gloomy	[12:35:56] holy s*** that paste didn't work as expected
2018-03-10 17:39:48	gloomy	[12:36:02] just a sec
2018-03-10 17:39:48	@ngxbot	[12:36:54] Paste from gloomy: [ https://paste.ngx.cc/76 ]
2018-03-10 17:39:48	gloomy	[12:37:08] There you go, that's my config.
2018-03-10 17:39:48	vandemar	[12:37:14] why did you configure nginx to proxy to an https upstream?  I highly doubt node is speaking ssl.
2018-03-10 17:39:48	gloomy	[12:37:52] 2018/03/10 13:22:32 [error] 9413#9413: *2 peer closed connection in SSL handshake while SSL handshaking to upstream, client: 81.11.163.52, server: groep4.webdev.ilabt.imec.be, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "https://127.0.0.1:8080/", host: "groep4.webdev.ilabt.imec.be" that's the error coming up in my log
2018-03-10 17:39:48	gloomy	[12:38:38] Uh, so what's the approach I should take to serve the app through https?
2018-03-10 17:39:48	vandemar	[12:38:53] proxy_pass https://127.0.0.1:8080;
2018-03-10 17:39:48	vandemar	[12:38:59] *why* did you make that https?
2018-03-10 17:39:48	gloomy	[12:39:32] Because I don't really understand what I'm doing :D
2018-03-10 17:39:48	vandemar	[12:39:53] there are two hops, you get that, right?  From the client (browser) to nginx, and then from nginx to the upstream/backend node process.  You told nginx to use ssl for that backend leg, and it's trying, and node doesn't speak ssl, so it fails.
2018-03-10 17:39:48	gloomy	[12:39:54] But now that you point it out, it doesn't really make sense indeed
2018-03-10 17:39:48	gloomy	[12:40:11] yep, just realised it.
2018-03-10 17:39:48	vandemar	[12:40:52] ssl on the backend connection has nothing to do with ssl on the nginx-to-client connection.
2018-03-10 17:39:48	gloomy	[12:41:32] Yes, got it now, I was a bit confused as to what was communicating with what
2018-03-10 17:39:48	vandemar	[12:42:03] there shouldn't be any introductory/non-advanced nginx guide showing https to a backend, and if there is the author should be bitched at.  that's fairly unusual.
2018-03-10 17:39:48	gloomy	[12:44:44] No no, I followed a guide on how to setup nginx with node and another on how to setup https and was trying to combine the two
2018-03-10 17:39:48	gloomy	[12:45:28] Ok, works now :) Thanks for heling
2018-03-10 17:39:48	gloomy	[12:45:30] helping *
2018-03-10 17:39:48	vandemar	[12:45:40] right but the usual guides for how to set up https shouldn't talk about https *to a backend* except as a clearly labelled special/unusual case
2018-03-10 17:39:48	gloomy	[12:47:13] They didn't, it was just me misunderstanding it :-)

2018-03-10 18:13:59	devwannabe	[05:19:49] I finally got CORS to work after so many hours debugging it! I placed my answer on my post - https://serverfault.com/questions/900736/still-get-data-even-there-is-a-cors-issue-in-nginx
2018-03-10 18:13:59	devwannabe	[05:20:27] I saw a PHP code doing the same thing. So I tried telling nginx what it should do and it worked!
2018-03-10 18:13:59	devwannabe	[05:22:59] test-cors.org cannot get it now - https://i.imgur.com/CP6oZcZ.png
2018-03-10 18:13:59	devwannabe	[05:24:17] i'm still wondering why the nginx rules I did at work works without having to do this kind of IF statements
2018-03-10 18:13:59	gloomy	[12:29:11] Hi :)
2018-03-10 18:13:59	gloomy	[12:30:33] I'm very new to nginx. I want my webserver to serve a node (express) app, the right way is to setup nginx as a reverse proxy and direct requests to the node server, right ?
2018-03-10 18:13:59	gloomy	[12:32:59] The node server is up and listening on port 8080, locally I can do curl 127.0.0.1:8080 and I get my page
2018-03-10 18:13:59	gloomy	[12:33:44] but when I try to access it from my other machine, I get either a 404 with the IP address or a 502(bad gateway) with the domain name
2018-03-10 18:13:59	vandemar	[12:35:23] gloomy: yes, you'd reverse proxy to node.  check the error logs for 404 or 502 reasons.
2018-03-10 18:13:59	@ngxbot	[12:35:28] Paste from gloomy: [ https://paste.ngx.cc/3f ]
2018-03-10 18:13:59	gloomy	[12:35:56] holy s*** that paste didn't work as expected
2018-03-10 18:13:59	gloomy	[12:36:02] just a sec
2018-03-10 18:13:59	@ngxbot	[12:36:54] Paste from gloomy: [ https://paste.ngx.cc/76 ]
2018-03-10 18:13:59	gloomy	[12:37:08] There you go, that's my config.
2018-03-10 18:13:59	vandemar	[12:37:14] why did you configure nginx to proxy to an https upstream?  I highly doubt node is speaking ssl.
2018-03-10 18:13:59	gloomy	[12:37:52] 2018/03/10 13:22:32 [error] 9413#9413: *2 peer closed connection in SSL handshake while SSL handshaking to upstream, client: 81.11.163.52, server: groep4.webdev.ilabt.imec.be, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "https://127.0.0.1:8080/", host: "groep4.webdev.ilabt.imec.be" that's the error coming up in my log
2018-03-10 18:13:59	gloomy	[12:38:38] Uh, so what's the approach I should take to serve the app through https?
2018-03-10 18:13:59	vandemar	[12:38:53] proxy_pass https://127.0.0.1:8080;
2018-03-10 18:13:59	vandemar	[12:38:59] *why* did you make that https?
2018-03-10 18:13:59	gloomy	[12:39:32] Because I don't really understand what I'm doing :D
2018-03-10 18:13:59	vandemar	[12:39:53] there are two hops, you get that, right?  From the client (browser) to nginx, and then from nginx to the upstream/backend node process.  You told nginx to use ssl for that backend leg, and it's trying, and node doesn't speak ssl, so it fails.
2018-03-10 18:13:59	gloomy	[12:39:54] But now that you point it out, it doesn't really make sense indeed
2018-03-10 18:13:59	gloomy	[12:40:11] yep, just realised it.
2018-03-10 18:13:59	vandemar	[12:40:52] ssl on the backend connection has nothing to do with ssl on the nginx-to-client connection.
2018-03-10 18:13:59	gloomy	[12:41:32] Yes, got it now, I was a bit confused as to what was communicating with what
2018-03-10 18:13:59	vandemar	[12:42:03] there shouldn't be any introductory/non-advanced nginx guide showing https to a backend, and if there is the author should be bitched at.  that's fairly unusual.
2018-03-10 18:13:59	gloomy	[12:44:44] No no, I followed a guide on how to setup nginx with node and another on how to setup https and was trying to combine the two
2018-03-10 18:13:59	gloomy	[12:45:28] Ok, works now :) Thanks for heling
2018-03-10 18:13:59	gloomy	[12:45:30] helping *
2018-03-10 18:13:59	vandemar	[12:45:40] right but the usual guides for how to set up https shouldn't talk about https *to a backend* except as a clearly labelled special/unusual case
2018-03-10 18:13:59	gloomy	[12:47:13] They didn't, it was just me misunderstanding it :-)

2018-03-11 03:16:28	merlincorey	MathNeverEnds: it seems like voker57 might have been on a good track -- if you send "proper" CORS headers (and that may involve some DNS entry setting perhaps to help out, though I think you can do it by IP as well) then you should not have a problem any longer
2018-03-11 03:16:41	merlincorey	MathNeverEnds: that said if you truly want nginx can probably be made to do some gymnastics of course
2018-03-11 03:18:24	MathNeverEnds	merlincorey, i'm not sure what proper cors headers would mean
2018-03-11 03:18:51	MathNeverEnds	merlincorey, also do you mean sending them from the browser or sending them from the server?
2018-03-11 03:21:16	merlincorey	MathNeverEnds: the backend server should send them, I believe, and potentially the frontend server (nginx) as well for the static assets
2018-03-11 03:21:23	merlincorey	lemme see if I can find a decent guide real quick
2018-03-11 03:22:02	MathNeverEnds	The value of the 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' header in the response is '' which must be 'true' when the request's credentials mode is 'include'. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.
2018-03-11 03:22:22	MathNeverEnds	That is the error that I receive because the cookies don't persist from after I have the user login.
2018-03-11 03:23:07	voker57	MathNeverEnds: read this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS
2018-03-11 03:23:46	merlincorey	https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/ <<< this looks reasonable as well though i think it is more dated
2018-03-11 03:24:23	merlincorey	but yeah you want to essentially send some combination of "Access-Control-*" headers specifying what domains, etc are able to do cross origin requests
2018-03-11 03:24:57	voker57	basically you need to set Access-Control-Allow-Origin on backend servers to address/mask of your frontend
2018-03-11 03:25:39	MathNeverEnds	Okay, so in the javascript i have the client calling directly to the backend URL
2018-03-11 03:25:50	MathNeverEnds	is this fundamentally wrong?
