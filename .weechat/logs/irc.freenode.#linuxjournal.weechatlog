2018-02-24 22:45:51	swift110-phone_	[03:24:18] That's cool I used gmail earlier today
2018-02-24 22:45:51	nq	[08:00:41] hello
2018-02-24 22:45:51	nq	[08:03:49] i have a query i'm trying to link a network printer on cups on the cmd its pings the ip adress on cups using socket  comes back with an error recoverable network is busy retry in 5seconds please assist
2018-02-24 22:45:51	Jedicus	[15:45:29] whew....  had a bit of a panic.  there's a gmail account that I use for testing email problems mycompany@gmail.com and there was a "Was this you?" activity email check that said ther was a sign in from an IP in Ukraine
2018-02-24 22:45:51	Jedicus	[15:47:56] looks like google's IP geolocation database is wrong.  The IP is really in Virgina, owned by Opera Software AS.
2018-02-24 22:45:51	Jedicus	[15:49:29] I had given the password to a coworker years ago.  I haven't seen him yet, but I know he's an Opera dork, and they have some kinf of built in vpn privacy mode
2018-02-24 22:45:51	bkidwell	[15:54:15] geolocating IP addresses is not quite black magic, but it's not very much like street addresses though
2018-02-24 22:45:51	bkidwell	[15:55:34] were you using one of the Opera builds that uses a proxy to clean stuff up and avoid crushing the client?
2018-02-24 22:45:51	bkidwell	[15:55:53] oh oh. missed the last line
2018-02-24 22:45:51	bkidwell	[15:57:09] speaking of proxy-needed... I was browsing video cameras+recorders on Amazon last night on my Blackberry with 2GB of RAM... and the Amazon product pages caused an OOM
2018-02-24 22:45:51	bkidwell	[15:57:28] they can't just give you text and some pictures
2018-02-24 22:45:51	bkidwell	[15:57:52] it has to be 4MiB of JavaScript code and more in-memory objects than any one programmer could understand
2018-02-24 22:45:51	bkidwell	[15:58:11] ... and I lost my unsaved notes in the todo app because of the OOM. thanks Amazon
2018-02-24 22:45:51	bkidwell	[15:58:41] does Android use swap? I'm pretty sure my Blackberry (QNX) does not
2018-02-24 22:45:51	Jedicus	[16:00:04] I expect Amazon tests for iphone and andriod and has thinner pages for them, but blackberry?
2018-02-24 22:45:51	bkidwell	[16:00:25] I can pretty much guarantee this shit would crash a 6 year old Android phone
2018-02-24 22:45:51	bkidwell	[16:01:02] why would it give me heavier "mobile" pages than what they give to an Android phone?
2018-02-24 22:45:51	Jedicus	[16:01:43] Facebook for iPhone has a new "Privacy" switch.  But it's a VPN that sends all your traffic through facebook, so they can see all of the things just because you thought "privacy" would be good to turn "on"
2018-02-24 22:45:51	bkidwell	[16:02:31] what goes through the proxy besides Facebook pages? story link targets?
2018-02-24 22:45:51	Jedicus	[16:02:33] it probably gives heavier pages be default and thins them if it detects a list of browsers they know are phones
2018-02-24 22:45:51	Jedicus	[16:02:37] by
2018-02-24 22:45:51	bkidwell	[16:03:18] if you go to m.facebook.com in Firefox you get clean simple stupid bliss and no missing content
2018-02-24 22:45:51	bkidwell	[16:03:21] :^)
2018-02-24 22:45:51	bkidwell	[16:03:26] loads instantaneously
2018-02-24 22:45:51	bkidwell	[16:04:08] well, Firefox for desktop gets that result, anyway
2018-02-24 22:45:51	bkidwell	[16:04:23] I haven't tried it lately on Firefox for Android
2018-02-24 22:45:51	bkidwell	[16:05:01] I use FaceSlim to wrap the site in a browser that has an ID that Facebook believes would never be able to run Facebook Messenger, so it doesn't deny access to FAcebook Messenger
2018-02-24 22:45:51	bkidwell	[16:05:10] ^ for mobile devices
2018-02-24 22:45:51	Jedicus	[16:07:34] https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-onavo-protect-vpn-privacy/
2018-02-24 22:45:51	Jedicus	[16:08:07] I misspoke.  the setting is called "Protect"

2018-02-25 06:27:59	noahm	get off my lawn.
2018-02-25 06:28:06	qwarlock	heh heh heh
2018-02-25 06:28:41	qwarlock	anyone know a good tutorial/ walk through on pxeservers in the age of UEFI?
2018-02-25 06:29:03	qwarlock	I had one for years working great in bios mode... but UEFI... eeeeep!
2018-02-25 06:29:50	noahm	interesting. I would not think that uefi would require explicit support from the pxe server.
2018-02-25 06:30:34	qwarlock	It really changes everything.
2018-02-25 06:30:55	qwarlock	even just getting a netboot of knoppix did not work
2018-02-25 06:31:09	noahm	of course, but there's nothing about pxe that is bios specific.
2018-02-25 06:31:44	qwarlock	I like having gparted, clonezilla, knoppix, and a few others on it.... was more goofy fun though sometunes really helpfull.
2018-02-25 06:32:05	noahm	pxe is basically dhcp + tftp. doesn't matter whether you're using legacy bios of uefi.
2018-02-25 06:32:13	noahm	unless your uefi implementation is buggy :)
2018-02-25 06:32:33	qwarlock	except you can only offer what the client computer can now accept.
2018-02-25 06:32:50	noahm	exactly. your uefi implentation is buggy.
2018-02-25 06:33:05	qwarlock	Oh I am sure of that... I was really comfy with bios mode installs.. uefi still... little foggy
2018-02-25 06:33:41	qwarlock	so it is how the uefi portion is configured on the pxe server then
2018-02-25 06:34:14	noahm	exactly what is failing when you try to pxeboot your uefi client?
2018-02-25 06:34:21	qwarlock	I am hoping to entice Kyle Rankin to do another article updating is tutorials on PXE servers
2018-02-25 06:34:30	noahm	does the server see a dhcp request?
2018-02-25 06:34:50	qwarlock	Oh yea I get the offer
2018-02-25 06:34:54	noahm	and tftp?
2018-02-25 06:35:33	qwarlock	I  think it does though not sure how to tell on that part.  It comes in silently... but does not boot
2018-02-25 06:35:58	qwarlock	I still think uefi is a plot to make linux hard again
2018-02-25 06:37:04	noahm	do you have secureboot enabled on the client?
2018-02-25 06:37:12	qwarlock	I will prolly trash the server then and try and build from scratch.  Something on the uefi part was just missed I think.
2018-02-25 06:37:29	qwarlock	I had that off
2018-02-25 06:38:06	qwarlock	part of this too is that microsoft let the manufacturers know it will no longer bios to have a legacy mode
2018-02-25 06:38:41	noahm	legacy bios is garbage; it's amazing we got as much out of it as we did...
2018-02-25 06:39:05	noahm	in any case, double check that the tftp server is sending the bits it's supposed to be sending.
2018-02-25 06:39:16	qwarlock	le sigh... guess I really have to learn uefi.. arg
2018-02-25 06:39:53	qwarlock	ok will do
2018-02-25 06:39:56	noahm	good luck.
2018-02-25 06:40:01	qwarlock	heh heh thaks
2018-02-25 06:40:03	qwarlock	thanks
2018-02-25 06:40:34	qwarlock	you should have seen me try and get my Alien laptop running with Slackware... oy!  That took a minute!
2018-02-25 06:42:28	qwarlock	By the way... the smartest people still are in IRC!

2018-03-10 17:39:49	mate-user	[15:25:25] really i need it to be seen by more linux users
2018-03-10 17:39:49	mate-user	[15:26:15] i remember linuxjournal.com and opensource.com ran some polls like this, but it was possible to vote more than once using private mode in your browser
2018-03-10 17:39:49	mate-user	[15:26:48] strawpoll is immune to that kind of multiple voting by a spam voter
2018-03-10 17:39:49	mate-user	[15:26:57] so i hope it will show more accurate data
2018-03-10 17:39:49	bkidwell	[17:01:18] > strawpoll is immune to that kind of multiple voting by a spam voter
2018-03-10 17:39:49	bkidwell	[17:01:24] that sound like a challenge mate-user
2018-03-10 17:39:49	mate-user	[17:02:18] haha yeah it can be spammed easily by random votes
2018-03-10 17:39:49	skorous	[17:06:14] it totally did sound like a challenge. :)
2018-03-10 17:39:49	mate-user	[17:27:52] haha i guess
2018-03-10 17:39:49	Jedicus	[18:08:12] Not as bad as the LifeLock CEO who published his social security number bragging about their horrible service

2018-03-10 17:39:49	cmaloney	[18:41:56] I swear it's a tradition that needs to be stopped
2018-03-10 17:39:49	cmaloney	[18:42:10] It's a ritual. We've lost the meaning long ago
2018-03-10 17:39:49	codingpanic	[18:50:16] Citrix XenDesktop is such a pile of poo
2018-03-10 17:39:49	codingpanic	[18:51:52] yeah, dalight savings is useless
2018-03-10 17:39:49	codingpanic	[18:52:07] certain contributed to Seasonal Affective Disorder, in my case
2018-03-10 17:39:49	codingpanic	[18:52:22] wake up, dark out, go to work, get out of work, guess what? Its stilld ark out
2018-03-10 17:39:49	codingpanic	[18:52:33] just let the daylight naturally shift
2018-03-10 17:39:49	codingpanic	[18:52:53] wake up dark out, go to work, get out, and have 1 hr of light left
2018-03-10 17:39:49	codingpanic	[18:52:58] would be _amazing_
2018-03-10 17:39:49	Markow	[19:23:26] ❝Happy Women's Day❞ out there to all of the dynamic Linux, Unix & Open Source enthusiasts that make it much better ❗    🌹👩🌹

2018-03-10 17:39:49	Jedicus	[21:56:49] I've seen some TV commercials for swagbucks
2018-03-10 17:39:49	Jedicus	[21:59:36] it does sort of seem like a pyramid scheme, or at least something that marketing people hope will build loyal customers, but it just results in lost revenue from un-loyal 1-time customers who come for the free thing and then jump to the next.  like groupon
