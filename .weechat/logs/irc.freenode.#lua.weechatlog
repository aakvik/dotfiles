2018-01-04 14:16:32	blxrry	is there such thing as JS to Lua translator 
2018-01-04 14:16:32	daurnimator	RhodiumToad: yeah I was curious about `spack("BBB",`  vs string.char(
2018-01-04 14:16:32	daurnimator	blxrry: yes. CASTL.
2018-01-04 14:16:32	RhodiumToad	good point about gsub.
2018-01-04 14:16:32	daurnimator	blxrry: https://github.com/PaulBernier/castl sadly not maintained at the moment
2018-01-04 14:16:32	RhodiumToad	daurnimator: on my machine, on lua 5.3, it takes about 0.5s per megabyte of decoded output
2018-01-04 14:16:32	blxrry	Thanks daurnimator ill check it out
2018-01-04 14:16:32	RhodiumToad	actually a bit less than that
2018-01-04 14:16:32	RhodiumToad	2.25 megabytes/second
2018-01-04 14:16:32	daurnimator	RhodiumToad: btw, coding-style wise, I prefer an iterator for things like headers
2018-01-04 14:16:32	daurnimator	RhodiumToad: so I'd have e.g. :each_header()
2018-01-04 14:16:32	blxrry	I wish there was a box i could just copy and paste my JS into and it turns to be Lua 
2018-01-04 14:16:32	RhodiumToad	less convenient when some headers need to have defaults
2018-01-04 14:16:32	daurnimator	RhodiumToad: right. but then I guess I'd write :read_headers() or something that returns them as an object
2018-01-04 14:16:32	daurnimator	blxrry: that's what CASTL is/what. sort of.
2018-01-04 14:16:32	daurnimator	is/was
2018-01-04 14:16:32	daurnimator	blxrry: you gave the command a .js file, and it would spit out a .lua file
2018-01-04 14:16:32	daurnimator	blxrry: would be easy to turn into a web-service
2018-01-04 14:16:32	daurnimator	blxrry: but that all assumes I want to write javascript and run on the lua VM..... which is the opposite of what I want! (see https://fengari.io/ )
2018-01-04 14:16:32	blxrry	Thank you. Bascially what happened was I coded in JS for a game on unreal engine, and now i need to transfer it to a different IDE that only takes Lua. Would CASTL be able to do that (with whatever syntax problems it gives me) 
2018-01-04 14:16:32	daurnimator	blxrry: yeah it would work. but as mentioned above: CASTL is unmaintained (and has open bugs).
2018-01-04 14:16:32	blxrry	daurnimator: Thanks 
2018-01-04 14:16:32	[xyzzy]	> CASTL is unmaintained (and has open bugs).
2018-01-04 14:16:32	[xyzzy]	that just means extra practice
2018-01-04 14:16:32	blxrry	duarinmator: hey got any web sights or book recommendations for learning Lua?
2018-01-04 14:16:32	blxrry	website*
2018-01-04 14:16:32	__number5__	blxrry: https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html 
2018-01-04 14:16:32	daurnimator	blxrry: PIL (4th edition) is the best resource.
2018-01-04 14:16:32	blxrry	daurnimator: Thanks man! 
2018-01-04 14:16:32	mekhami	hey, i need a simple function that basically takes a number, 0-100, and finds the closest 10. like if i get the number 48, I have a lookup table { [1] = empty; [2] = mostlyEmpty; ... [9] = mostlyFull; [10] = full; }
2018-01-04 14:16:32	mekhami	so i could call this function with 48 sa the arugment and get 'halfwayFull' which would be assigned to [5] i guess.
2018-01-04 14:16:32	furq	math.floor(n/10+0.5)
2018-01-04 14:16:32	mekhami	what if i don't have access to math.floor
2018-01-04 14:16:32	RhodiumToad	why wouldn't you?
2018-01-04 14:16:32	mekhami	i have access to this i tjhink https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Lua_Functions
2018-01-04 14:16:32	mniip	((n/10+0.5)..""):match("^[^.]*")+0
2018-01-04 14:16:32	mekhami	it's a subset of the lua api
2018-01-04 14:16:32	mekhami	i will try the math.floor thing though
2018-01-04 14:16:32	RhodiumToad	(i - ((i+5)%10-5))/10
2018-01-04 14:16:32	mekhami	seems like i can use math.floor
2018-01-04 14:16:32	mekhami	thank you all though for the alternatives
2018-01-04 14:16:32	[xyzzy]	if you don't have access to math.floor then you need to find the person responsible and slowly remove their skin with a potato peeler
2018-01-04 14:16:32	furq	watch out for [xyzzy]...he's insanley sick + twisted...
2018-01-04 14:16:32	[xyzzy]	lua is real shit
2018-01-04 14:16:32	furq	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DH-dk3oXcAAXofv.jpg
2018-01-04 14:16:32	furq	looking good [xyzzy] 
2018-01-04 14:16:32	mekhami	 
2018-01-04 14:16:32	daurnimator	mekhami: agreed
2018-01-04 14:16:32	mekhami	sorry about that. my trackpad screws me up from time to time
2018-01-04 14:16:32	blxrry	anyone got Unreal Engine experience, wondering if i can convert BP's into raw code

2018-01-16 10:17:57	ArRay_	but then it may match too much things…
2018-01-16 10:17:57	RhodiumToad	always the hazard of parsing
2018-01-16 10:17:57	steamport	ArRay_, how would i make it so the [] isn't included in the output?
2018-01-16 10:17:57	steamport	or is that not possible with patterns
2018-01-16 10:17:57	RhodiumToad	use ( ) to mark the capture part
2018-01-16 10:17:57	ArRay_	use a group
2018-01-16 10:17:57	ArRay_	what RhodiumToad said
2018-01-16 10:17:57	steamport	well uh
2018-01-16 10:17:57	steamport	adding a ( before [a and a ) after +% makes it not match
2018-01-16 10:17:57	steamport	for example, %[([a-zA-Z0-9/_%-]+%.[a-zA-Z0-9_%-]+%)] won't match
2018-01-16 10:17:57	steamport	but %[[a-zA-Z0-9/_%-]+%.[a-zA-Z0-9_%-]+%] will
2018-01-16 10:17:57	ArRay_	try %[([a-zA-Z0-9/_%-]+%.[a-zA-Z0-9_%-]+)%]
2018-01-16 10:17:57	ArRay_	the last % is used to escape the ]
2018-01-16 10:17:57	steamport	ok thanks
2018-01-16 10:17:57	steamport	also
2018-01-16 10:17:57	steamport	I'm trying to convert another regex to patterns
2018-01-16 10:17:57	steamport	original regex is \^([0-9a-fA-F~]{5,40})
2018-01-16 10:17:57	steamport	i've tried \^([0-9a-fA-F]+%)%
2018-01-16 10:17:57	steamport	and also \^(0-9a-fA-F)+%"
2018-01-16 10:17:57	jdarnley	\ is not for escaping in Lua patterns
2018-01-16 10:17:57	jdarnley	so the start should be %^ assuming that is supposed to be escaped
2018-01-16 10:17:57	steamport	Thanks
2018-01-16 10:17:57	RhodiumToad	if you want to include the {5,40} part that'll mean a lot of repetition in the pattern
2018-01-16 10:17:57	jdarnley	Plus I think you dropped the tilde somewhere
2018-01-16 10:17:57	steamport	YES

2018-01-16 10:17:57	furq	you can imagine they have some hot-ass takes on that
2018-01-16 10:17:57	furq	also by "a racist" i mean someone who spent several hours giving it "DEBATE ME, FOOL..." about why ethnonationalism is good
2018-01-16 10:17:57	furq	and then within a short amount of time dropped the pretense and just started openly referring to himself as a racist
2018-01-16 10:17:57	neffi	you can call cmtptr by his name

2018-01-16 10:17:57	furq	and i don't think he likes animes
2018-01-16 10:17:57	furq	also yeah you know that the animes guy is way worse than the actual self-proclaimed racist
2018-01-16 10:17:57	furq	lol he just referred to the democratic party as "leftists"
2018-01-16 10:17:57	furq	imagine actually believing that

2018-01-16 16:07:08	zy]x[yz	and today, a month later, some other guy in another office has sent out a code review with a change to that library which changes all of the macros back to hard-coded format specifiers

2018-01-16 22:36:49	LordRyan	yeah sure
2018-01-16 22:36:54	LordRyan	have you read chapter 16 of Programming in Lua?
2018-01-16 22:37:41	Stigma	So basicaly i've already used and reused and applied to my purpose other people's oop structures but i cant understand most of the syntax tbh
2018-01-16 22:37:48	Stigma	omw
2018-01-16 22:39:04	Stigma	Yeah i've seen this but i've also seen something like the following when defining a metatable
2018-01-16 22:39:54	LordRyan	Well if you're using chapter 16, my solution would be "don't use chapter 16"
2018-01-16 22:41:38	Stigma	local MyClass = {} ; 
2018-01-16 22:41:38	Stigma	MyClass.__index = MyClass
2018-01-16 22:41:55	Stigma	I basically got braincooked when i saw this
2018-01-16 22:42:05	Stigma	on a different tutorial

2018-01-16 22:45:52	LordRyan	The only time I've seen OOP be useful is when you have an "object" with a bunch of common methods acting on that object.
2018-01-16 22:46:06	Stigma	I also remember tweaking around this in Love2d and having the trouble of each instance of a class would overwrite the other
2018-01-16 22:46:47	LordRyan	In that case it was probably you accidentally calling functions on the class instead of the instance.

2018-01-17 02:06:16	zy]x[yz	but still I'm sure that's way less than the full set of all permutations
2018-01-17 02:06:23	furq	i only recommended fcrackzip because you gave the impression it was a very short alphabetic password
2018-01-17 02:06:37	zy]x[yz	I thought it was but it looks like maybe not
2018-01-17 02:06:43	furq	also i think it starts at 6 characters by default so you prob want to use -l 1
2018-01-17 02:06:48	[xyzzy]	tbh i'd write my own zip cracker in node
2018-01-17 02:06:52	furq	all the matches i was getting were 6 characters
2018-01-17 02:06:53	zy]x[yz	I did -l 3-5
2018-01-17 02:06:57	furq	oh ok
2018-01-17 02:07:15	zy]x[yz	I guess I might as well have started at 1...
2018-01-17 02:07:24	zy]x[yz	it probably is a 1-character password

2018-01-17 10:16:26	Entok	void addBytes(const char* bytes, size_t size);
2018-01-17 10:16:27	Stigma	i dont either
2018-01-17 10:16:36	Entok	but most other stuff nono source is lua
2018-01-17 10:16:38	Entok	so its easy
2018-01-17 10:16:48	Stigma	I'd assume you'd want to build a server script by yourself
2018-01-17 10:16:58	Stigma	You built the game from scratch right ?
2018-01-17 10:17:07	Entok	nope
2018-01-17 10:17:10	Entok	its a server of a game
2018-01-17 10:17:17	Stigma	ah
2018-01-17 10:17:25	Entok	but its all there u can basicly change whatever u want if ur good enough
2018-01-17 10:17:57	Stigma	How would the server usually save databases and load them up on that game ?
2018-01-17 10:18:20	Entok	oo
2018-01-17 10:18:33	Stigma	does it use like
2018-01-17 10:18:35	Stigma	SQLite
2018-01-17 10:18:36	Entok	uniserver
2018-01-17 10:19:05	Entok	https://gyazo.com/cad162f344e5c2e9bffc4083f4e89bba
2018-01-17 10:19:21	Stigma	Kinda weird making erver script without knowing what the hell is in the game
2018-01-17 10:19:24	Entok	i also dont know alot about that thing
2018-01-17 10:19:41	Stigma	Oh it uses mysql
2018-01-17 10:19:51	Stigma	And i assume apache for webpage
2018-01-17 10:20:13	Stigma	If it uses mysql i would say it has a standalone version which come with the server
2018-01-17 10:20:20	Entok	"server webpage"  "game sourcefiles"  "lua easy script files" "sprites game items"    i know the third basicly gonna start on 4th later.
2018-01-17 10:20:39	Entok	i know a little bit about the server webpage stuff but its the easy part of the server thing
2018-01-17 10:20:41	Stigma	So i assume you can trick lua into saving variables into databases on mysql which is stored on a local database file
2018-01-17 10:20:50	Entok	yes
2018-01-17 10:21:15	Entok	when u talked about the database thing i remember alot of variables are stored there
2018-01-17 10:21:24	Entok	like weapon skills levels.
2018-01-17 10:21:33	Stigma	And it is pretty much how servers do it, saving to database usually sqlite and mysql
2018-01-17 10:21:57	Entok	its hard code tho
2018-01-17 10:22:05	Stigma	If you could mimic those weapon skill levels i guess you could do the same for a grid class
2018-01-17 10:22:11	Stigma	Everything hardcoded 
2018-01-17 10:22:30	Stigma	Since im an amateur i usually do my own crap
2018-01-17 10:22:40	Entok	i dont understand how ppls can do such crazy coding. must be genius ;:O

2018-01-17 10:22:55	Stigma	I may be wrong but
2018-01-17 10:23:02	Entok	same i look at fullcode take some parts of it lern then adapt it to my own liking
2018-01-17 10:23:30	Stigma	If you cant understand hardcode its probably cause the developer wasnt the best on describing, commenting and making a organized pleasent work
2018-01-17 10:23:55	Entok	int32_t getHealth() const {
2018-01-17 10:23:55	Entok	   return health;
2018-01-17 10:24:06	Entok	like what does int32_t meen
2018-01-17 10:24:19	Entok	internet stuff so complex
2018-01-17 10:24:27	Stigma	Usually a programmer is some1 who looks at other ppls code and shits its pants cause doesnt understand wtf was in their heads
2018-01-17 10:24:35	Entok	haha
2018-01-17 10:24:36	Stigma	Well accordngly to that
2018-01-17 10:24:39	Stigma	int is an integer
2018-01-17 10:24:45	Stigma	32 bit integer
2018-01-17 10:24:54	Entok	i dont know about integer but it looks important
2018-01-17 10:25:08	Stigma	thats the only thing i can assume
2018-01-17 10:25:08	Entok	void and bool also
2018-01-17 10:25:13	Stigma	aah
2018-01-17 10:25:15	Stigma	wow
2018-01-17 10:25:23	Stigma	thats the basics of algorithm maaan 
2018-01-17 10:25:33	Entok	no clue about it ^^
2018-01-17 10:25:45	Entok	i did ahk before lua. so i dont know that complex coding.
2018-01-17 10:25:51	Stigma	ahah you should try to enter a course, online or not on algorithm
2018-01-17 10:25:59	Stigma	How old are ya
2018-01-17 10:26:02	Stigma	still studying ?
2018-01-17 10:26:03	Entok	27
2018-01-17 10:26:07	Stigma	ah
2018-01-17 10:26:20	Stigma	Take an online small course maybe
2018-01-17 10:26:23	Stigma	youtube is good
2018-01-17 10:26:29	Stigma	Its really quick
2018-01-17 10:26:34	Stigma	i can explain those concepts
2018-01-17 10:26:57	Stigma	Void is the shit that isnt used if i recall at least on lua
2018-01-17 10:27:16	Stigma	But on C its to start or set a global identifier (?)
2018-01-17 10:27:21	Stigma	as for the rest
2018-01-17 10:27:29	Stigma	Int and Bool are both value types
2018-01-17 10:27:49	Stigma	Int is any whole number from minus infinite to infinite
2018-01-17 10:28:05	Stigma	Like -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

2018-01-17 10:28:19	Stigma	or boolean
2018-01-17 10:28:35	Stigma	its simply a value type that can only have a true or false value
2018-01-17 10:29:03	Stigma	On lua, every pointer is expected to be either true or false even if its value isnt a bool, like

2018-01-17 10:30:31	Stigma	so basically any non nil var is true
2018-01-17 10:30:46	Stigma	or any function that returns a value is true
2018-01-17 10:30:53	Stigma	Thats why it works the following
2018-01-17 10:31:03	Stigma	if keypressed() then DO STUFF end
2018-01-17 10:31:05	Entok	plant = savedplant+100000000   can i do something like: plant = savedplant+"variable"00000000
2018-01-17 10:31:41	Stigma	I dont know how could you use that tbh
2018-01-17 10:31:49	Entok	yes Stigma i lerned that the hard way about true or false
2018-01-17 10:31:57	Entok	so confusing
2018-01-17 10:32:05	Stigma	naah fam itz ez
2018-01-17 10:32:17	Entok	if var ~= nil then

2018-01-17 10:33:43	Stigma	i know something
2018-01-17 10:33:48	Stigma	called concatenate
2018-01-17 10:33:54	Entok	;/
2018-01-17 10:33:57	Stigma	you could do this way
2018-01-17 10:34:11	Entok	i see that error alot haha
2018-01-17 10:35:31	Stigma	plant = tonumber((savedplant + variable)..'0000000')
2018-01-17 10:35:33	Entok	everytime i code in lua i miss ahk.
2018-01-17 10:35:50	Entok	but what happends if i need the number in the middle
2018-01-17 10:35:55	Stigma	Its treating that code inside the tonumber function like a string
2018-01-17 10:36:01	Entok	plant = savedplant+000(variable)0000
2018-01-17 10:36:13	Stigma	thats a sumb right

2018-01-17 10:36:25	Entok	plant = savedplant+000..variable..0000
2018-01-17 10:36:36	Entok	like that maybe ?
2018-01-17 10:36:43	Stigma	concatenate only works with strings so 
2018-01-17 10:36:56	Entok	its not a string is a number error coming it feels like
2018-01-17 10:37:04	Stigma	plant = "savedplant+000"..variable.."0000"
2018-01-17 10:37:13	Entok	ya string
2018-01-17 10:37:14	Stigma	thats why tonumber()string
2018-01-17 10:37:19	Stigma	tonumber(tring)
2018-01-17 10:37:20	Stigma	*
2018-01-17 10:37:27	Entok	but number > string ?
2018-01-17 10:37:53	Stigma	tonumber() returns every number character inside a string to a number var
2018-01-17 10:38:05	Entok	but if its a number > string > number
2018-01-17 10:38:12	Entok	how do u get the string in the firstplace
2018-01-17 10:38:25	Stigma	like strin = "123" var = tonumber(strin)

2018-01-17 16:25:42	LordRyan	you use a modeline

2018-01-17 16:26:12	zy]x[yz	hydraz, I don't think I'm following your question.  are you asking whether I indent manually, or are you asking whether I use vim's expandtab feature?
2018-01-17 16:26:30	zy]x[yz	both are yes
2018-01-17 16:26:42	hydraz	I'm asking if, when indenting manually, you press a tab to insert N space characters, a tab to insert a tab, or hit the space bar N times
2018-01-17 16:26:47	zy]x[yz	in fact probably half the time I'm adjusting indentation with >> and <<
2018-01-17 16:26:49	Entok	if you indent ur code how do you know if u did finish the code or not ?
2018-01-17 16:27:03	Entok	how do u remember that the code needs work
2018-01-17 16:27:06	zy]x[yz	if it's my personal code, I'm pressing tab or >> to insert tabs

2018-01-17 16:27:20	hydraz	I see. that's fine.
2018-01-17 16:27:25	LordRyan	then when going into a project, i run `grep -R TODO .`
2018-01-17 16:27:29	zy]x[yz	notepad doesn't have these features as far as I'm aware
2018-01-17 16:27:32	Entok	why not use the code itself to remember what needs to be fixed. and scrapping indent ^^
2018-01-17 16:27:47	LordRyan	because indent is an important feature for code readability
2018-01-17 16:27:51	hydraz	because indentation makes the logic easier to follow
2018-01-17 16:27:56	zy]x[yz	Entok, why do you put spaces between words, sentences, and paragraphs?

2018-01-17 16:28:06	hydraz	you have a visual indication of what belongs what

2018-01-17 16:28:43	LordRyan	at least the one thing that Python does correctly is it requires proper indentation
2018-01-17 16:28:48	zy]x[yz	if it were the latter, we'd all still be writing assembly
2018-01-17 16:28:55	zash	why not both?

2018-01-17 16:29:17	LordRyan	zash: that's the optimal case, but first and foremost it should be human readable
2018-01-17 16:29:26	zy]x[yz	Entok, you do have to read it, though.

2018-01-17 16:30:06	LordRyan	on the plus side, I can thank you for the job security, considering I have a job solely because people write crap code and I have to fix it.
2018-01-17 16:30:15	hydraz	haha
2018-01-17 16:30:23	LordRyan	daurnimator: I've never really had too many complaints about the rules.
2018-01-17 16:30:44	LordRyan	I don't like the rules about when to break a line containing arguments, then tab back up to the opening parenthesis
2018-01-17 16:30:51	LordRyan	but besides that I think it is fine.
2018-01-17 16:31:46	daurnimator	LordRyan: callback hell in python gets *really* bad

2018-01-17 16:35:54	LordRyan	I know that there used to be a bunch of spaghetti code with decorator callbacks in the past, but I think it's probably gotten better now with the move of most things to async, or at least generators and behind-the-scenes coroutines.

2018-01-17 16:40:12	Entok	you meen the whole function ?
2018-01-17 16:41:10	Entok	you meen each block`? inside the funcs.
2018-01-17 16:41:27	hydraz	jesus christ
2018-01-17 16:41:32	Entok	im so confused ^^
2018-01-17 16:42:01	hydraz	if you see anything that starts a block of statements, indent
2018-01-17 16:42:17	hydraz	if you see anything that ends a block of statements ('end', 'until ...'), dedent

2018-01-17 16:43:29	hydraz	your if is indented wrong
2018-01-17 16:43:36	daurnimator	so is your function.

2018-01-17 16:43:44	Entok	i guess
2018-01-17 16:43:45	LordRyan	you're not supposed to indent the lines that start the block, or the `end`
2018-01-17 16:44:11	Entok	function > first if should be indendet ?
2018-01-17 16:44:16	LordRyan	http://sprunge.us/IKCh
2018-01-17 16:44:20	LordRyan	that is how it should be indented
2018-01-17 16:44:20	Entok	or should it stay same as the function
2018-01-17 16:44:36	Entok	if playerpos2 == playerpos then
2018-01-17 16:44:39	Entok	hard to spot ?
2018-01-17 16:44:57	zy]x[yz	no, it's not hard to spot because it's immediately followed by an indented line

2018-01-17 16:45:56	Entok	that first indent on all lines looks annoying to me ;/
2018-01-17 16:46:08	Entok	but i guess its right

2018-01-17 16:58:08	zy]x[yz	or use spaces

2018-01-17 16:58:18	Entok	where do i do that in notepad or on pc.
2018-01-17 16:58:21	q66	spaces are best
2018-01-17 16:58:25	zy]x[yz	probably in notepad

2018-01-17 17:02:51	Entok	not relly
2018-01-17 17:03:07	Entok	1 tab looks like 20 spaces
2018-01-17 17:03:12	Entok	and the width is 2 ^^
2018-01-17 17:03:25	daurnimator	8 on codepad.org
2018-01-17 17:03:26	Entok	would that not be 2 spacebars ?
2018-01-17 17:03:43	daurnimator	Entok: the idea of a tab is that different people like it to be different widths
2018-01-17 17:03:57	daurnimator	Entok: e.g. on github the default is 4. but you can change it with the ts query param
2018-01-17 17:04:06	Entok	i liked 2 in notepad
2018-01-17 17:04:22	q66	pretty sure in a web browser tab is always as wide as it's set in the web browser itself, and that tends to be 8 columns
2018-01-17 17:04:28	daurnimator	oh wait; github is 8 too I think
2018-01-17 17:04:28	Entok	y

2018-01-17 17:05:06	q66	this is exactly why i don't like tabs
2018-01-17 17:05:15	q66	why would i give people the freedom to make the code as wide as they like
2018-01-17 17:05:24	daurnimator	q66: I use different tab widths depending on what device I'm using.
2018-01-17 17:05:24	q66	they should see it as i intended it to be seen
2018-01-17 17:05:29	Entok	the one with alot of spaces are annoying to read
2018-01-17 17:05:40	zy]x[yz	of course, being a socialist you hate giving people freedom
2018-01-17 17:05:43	daurnimator	e.g. my home desktop with ultrawide monitor? 8 spaces. my laptop? 2 spaces.

2018-01-17 17:10:56	Entok	i did
2018-01-17 17:11:00	Entok	put it 2 but it changed nothing
2018-01-17 17:11:07	Entok	was 4
2018-01-17 17:11:38	Entok	oo
2018-01-17 17:11:42	Entok	there is a x replace with space
2018-01-17 17:12:36	q66	every reasonable editor has a setting that will make the tab key emit N spaces and shift+tab remove N spaces

2018-01-17 17:27:30	zy]x[yz	but functions in that are basically just jump labels
2018-01-17 17:27:35	Entok	return true

2018-01-17 17:27:37	q66	zy]x[yz: yeah, in batch too
2018-01-17 17:27:47	Entok	what does it return true to ?
2018-01-17 17:27:56	q66	the caller
2018-01-17 17:28:10	Entok	hmm
2018-01-17 17:28:16	q66	% local f = function() return 5 end; local five = f(); print(five)
2018-01-17 17:28:17	yalb	q66: 5
2018-01-17 17:28:26	Entok	alot of scrtipts have return false or true.
2018-01-17 17:28:32	Entok	thats why i thought a return is needed
2018-01-17 17:28:35	q66	that's because they return true or false
2018-01-17 17:29:13	Entok	would not a return be false ?

2018-01-17 17:31:18	hydraz	steamport: just how many nicks do you have
2018-01-17 17:31:35	Entok	is it the source code of the function that needs the return pbly.
2018-01-17 17:31:35	steamport	this is the main one i use for programming now
2018-01-17 17:31:50	zy]x[yz	Entok, you're using it all over your code.  "local spectators = Game.getSpectators(playerpos, false, true, 7, 7, 5, 5)
2018-01-17 17:31:53	zy]x[yz	"
2018-01-17 17:32:17	zy]x[yz	Game.getSpectators() returned something, and then you assigned it to your local variable spectators
2018-01-17 17:32:20	Entok	yes i know what those true and false stands for
2018-01-17 17:32:36	Entok	i think i udnerstand but randomly just putting like return false at the end
2018-01-17 17:32:39	Entok	thats what i dont get
2018-01-17 17:32:42	steamport	thanks, cqueues looks nice
2018-01-17 17:32:45	Entok	thats for the funtion right ?
2018-01-17 17:32:52	q66	true and false stands for true and false
2018-01-17 17:32:55	zy]x[yz	Entok, true and false are boolean values

2018-01-17 17:33:47	steamport	i was hoping to intergrate it into the bot
2018-01-17 17:33:47	Entok	Local function "code" return false end          > source code of the function gets a false ?
2018-01-17 17:33:58	steamport	I mean, i already got it linking to PRs/commits/files when you ask it too

2018-01-17 18:51:54	LordRyan	so the IRC library you're using, I'm guessing it doesn't use cqueues for it's sockets, does it?
2018-01-17 18:52:12	steamport	nope
2018-01-17 18:52:16	steamport	luasocket
2018-01-17 18:52:52	LordRyan	that'd be why then
2018-01-17 18:53:03	LordRyan	luasocket does not have support for cqueues' async library
2018-01-17 18:53:11	LordRyan	it should be pretty easy to migrate from luasocket to cqueues though
2018-01-17 18:53:45	steamport	is there another library that allows me to run multiple functions at once
2018-01-17 18:53:49	steamport	that doesn't interfere with luasocket
2018-01-17 18:54:05	steamport	i just need to be able to run a few loops at once, no advanced communication between them
2018-01-17 18:54:13	LordRyan	the best you're going to get is using threads, but that's going to be a bit more complex
2018-01-17 18:54:24	LordRyan	but i'd still suggest not using luasocket
2018-01-17 18:54:34	steamport	i'm already used to luasocket :/
2018-01-17 18:56:14	LordRyan	I don't think there's any component of luasocket that cqueues doesn't do better.
2018-01-17 18:56:34	steamport	hm
2018-01-17 18:57:39	steamport	how to convert luasocket code to cqueue socket code
2018-01-17 19:00:28	steamport	and is there any way to Http.request with cqueues
2018-01-17 19:00:45	LordRyan	you can install lua-http
2018-01-17 19:01:04	LordRyan	lua-http is a *much* better library than luasocket's, *and* has direct support for luasocket's http.request using a compatibility library
2018-01-17 19:02:17	LordRyan	https://github.com/wahern/cqueues/blob/master/examples/simple.get
2018-01-17 19:02:23	LordRyan	is probably the simplest example
2018-01-17 19:02:27	LordRyan	if you don't know Lua semantics, it might be difficult to read

2018-01-17 19:07:27	LordRyan	I'm not sure what you mean by those.
2018-01-17 19:07:39	steamport	apparently the irc library uses luasocket's socket.protect and socket.select

2018-01-17 19:08:10	LordRyan	socket.select is a mechanism that the library uses for multiple connections
2018-01-17 19:08:14	LordRyan	cqueues handles that by itself
2018-01-17 19:08:57	LordRyan	All that protect() does is protects functions from errors that the socket library can throw, which isn't relevant to cqueues.

2018-01-17 19:13:45	LordRyan	It'll mean a bit of rewriting but luasocket is pretty bad at doing things asynchronously
2018-01-17 19:15:07	daurnimator	steamport: looks very old.. e.g. still uses module() which fell out of favour over a decade ago
2018-01-17 19:15:43	daurnimator	steamport: however you can probably get it in working order
2018-01-17 19:16:00	steamport	it is over a decade old
2018-01-17 19:16:01	daurnimator	steamport: that said. what LordRyan mentioned, lua-irc-engine (https://github.com/mirrexagon/lua-irc-engine) is what I use
2018-01-17 19:16:04	steamport	i see commits from 2007 or 2009
2018-01-17 19:17:20	LordRyan	here's an example using cqueues https://github.com/hashbang/irc-bot
2018-01-17 19:17:24	LordRyan	just so you know a good starting point

2018-01-17 19:32:18	steamport	what about "socket.try(sock:receive())"
2018-01-17 19:32:27	daurnimator	steamport: having a quick look at lua-irc. you'd replace `_register_socket` with a function that creates a cqueues thread.
2018-01-17 19:32:38	steamport	ok
2018-01-17 19:32:50	steamport	i don't want the library itself to be multithreated
2018-01-17 19:32:54	steamport	threaded, even
2018-01-17 19:33:00	daurnimator	steamport: cqueues uses coroutines
2018-01-17 19:33:05	steamport	ohk
2018-01-17 19:33:05	daurnimator	(not OS threads)
2018-01-17 19:33:32	steamport	i don't want the library itself to make coroutines, but i want it to support being in a cqueues loop
2018-01-17 19:34:08	daurnimator	a cqueues thread is just a coroutine that uses cqueues functions to 'pause' the thread until a socket is ready. a cqueues loop runs cqueues threads.
2018-01-17 19:34:24	steamport	how would i create a cqueues thread, though
2018-01-17 19:34:47	daurnimator	steamport: `mycqueuesloop:wrap(function() .... end)` creates a cqueues thread and adds it to the loop
2018-01-17 19:35:24	steamport	but that makes no sense
2018-01-17 19:35:29	daurnimator	steamport: ?
2018-01-17 19:35:39	steamport	_register_socket just puts a socket into either rsockets or wsockets
2018-01-17 19:35:52	daurnimator	steamport: right. and :wrap adds a new thread to the cqueues main loop
2018-01-17 19:36:01	steamport	but what does that have to do with _register_socket
2018-01-17 19:36:27	daurnimator	steamport: _register_socket registers a socket with main_loop_iter
2018-01-17 19:36:37	daurnimator	(as in, it adds it to rsockets, for main_loop_iter to use)
2018-01-17 19:36:43	steamport	oh
2018-01-17 19:37:07	steamport	Also... what is the cqueues version of socket.try(sock:receive())
2018-01-17 19:38:02	daurnimator	steamport: so you have a decision to make before I answer that question: you can either A. keep using luasocket, but use them inside of cqueues. this will probably require you write some buffering code. or B. swap over to cqueues sockets.
2018-01-17 19:38:11	steamport	cqueus sockets
2018-01-17 19:38:31	daurnimator	steamport: then the equivalent is my_cqueues_sock:read()
2018-01-17 19:38:37	steamport	Ok
2018-01-17 19:38:55	steamport	thanks
2018-01-17 19:39:48	steamport	So, with main_loop_iter done with... uhh... what should become of _register_socket

2018-01-17 20:36:59	LordRyan	daurnimator: it's the opposite of select()
2018-01-17 20:37:02	LordRyan	Lua select()
2018-01-17 20:37:10	LordRyan	it'll drop an n number of arguments and return the rest
2018-01-17 20:37:51	LordRyan	which is basically just function(n,...)return table.unpack({...}, n)end, I think
2018-01-17 20:37:52	daurnimator	that's not the opposite. that *is* select.

2018-01-17 20:38:07	LordRyan	wait am I brain dead
2018-01-17 20:38:11	LordRyan	yeah i'm dumb that's basically select()
2018-01-17 20:38:30	daurnimator	select but off by one
2018-01-17 20:38:50	LordRyan	for whatever reason I had basically no idea why you wouldn't just use select() so I just thought it did the opposite.
2018-01-17 20:38:54	LordRyan	apologies for dumb.
2018-01-17 20:38:57	daurnimator	how dumb. probably left over from lua 5.0 or something

2018-01-17 20:43:04	daurnimator	steamport: no. "localhost" means listen only to http clients coming from the local computer

2018-01-17 20:43:16	steamport	oh
2018-01-17 20:43:27	daurnimator	steamport: "*" is a luasocket thing
2018-01-17 20:43:38	LordRyan	use 0.0.0.0 to listen on all interfaces
2018-01-17 20:43:45	daurnimator	steamport: I think you use 0.0.0.0 for listening to all ipv4
2018-01-17 20:43:54	steamport	ok thanks
2018-01-17 20:44:46	daurnimator	using "::" is likely to work too. as that is all ipv6. but most computers have v4-mapped-v6 turned on. so it effectively means all ipv4 or ipv6

2018-01-17 21:34:57	TomT0m	is that kind of stuffs worth mentioning in some lua wiki ?

2018-01-17 21:37:10	TomT0m	also, standard iterators are stateless, mine are stateful, but could not figure out how to work statelessly :) so I had to wrap them to make them stateful.
2018-01-17 21:37:16	daurnimator	steamport: to keep with the style of the existing code, you'd use: base.select

2018-01-17 23:26:30	RhodiumToad	I believe
2018-01-17 23:27:19	RhodiumToad	also it has a limit on unchecked errors - after returning an error some number of times (100 I think) it throws it instead
2018-01-17 23:27:33	RhodiumToad	see the clearerr() function
2018-01-17 23:35:23	steamport	errcode is 110, RhodiumToad

2018-01-18 00:15:33	RhodiumToad	are you setting a timeout on the socket?

2018-01-18 00:15:47	steamport	60
2018-01-18 00:15:48	RhodiumToad	if so, then it fired, and you didn't do clearerr() to clear it
2018-01-18 00:16:02	steamport	how do i clearerr upon timeout
2018-01-18 00:16:17	RhodiumToad	did you read the cqueues docs?

2018-01-18 01:48:15	q66	aquanight: nah
2018-01-18 01:48:18	q66	i think it says 3
2018-01-18 01:48:19	DigitalKiwi	ooh but the log file has weird things
2018-01-18 01:48:28	q66	M-b being one, M-^@ being other, M-( being the third
2018-01-18 01:48:32	q66	^ is probably an escape
2018-01-18 01:48:41	aquanight	oh I see it could be like CTRL+ALT+@
2018-01-18 01:48:51	aquanight	I was thinking of it like ALT+^, @
2018-01-18 01:49:12	aquanight	but still weird
2018-01-18 01:50:12	aquanight	hrm
2018-01-18 01:51:31	aquanight	q66: yeah you're right, it's using ^@ to represent NUL (with M- meaning | 0x80)
2018-01-18 01:52:04	q66	lol
2018-01-18 01:53:32	aquanight	I've always been of the opinion unicode doesn't do well in terminals
2018-01-18 01:54:02	q66	unicode just generally doesn't do well
2018-01-18 01:54:24	aquanight	it would've been fine if it stuck to just actual characters
2018-01-18 01:54:35	q66	you tell me
2018-01-18 01:54:39	aquanight	when you started including line separator and stuff things just got out of hand
2018-01-18 01:54:44	q66	i've been working on a unicode library recently
2018-01-18 01:54:48	aquanight	and emoji is just what the actual fuck
2018-01-18 01:55:11	AlexMax	aquanight: what do you mean?
2018-01-18 01:55:18	AlexMax	"line separator"?
2018-01-18 01:55:28	aquanight	https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2028/index.htm
2018-01-18 01:55:51	aquanight	emoji is not a thing we needed in unicode
2018-01-18 01:56:10	aquanight	I don't care about SMS. Make them use MMS and embed <img> tags, just keep that shit out of the fonts.
2018-01-18 01:56:13	AlexMax	uh
2018-01-18 01:56:18	AlexMax	ascii has always had control codes
2018-01-18 01:56:20	[xyzzy]	petition to eliminate unicode and make everybody use ascii
2018-01-18 01:56:32	[xyzzy]	solve a ton of problems at once
2018-01-18 01:56:41	AlexMax	anything below 0x20 is a control character in ascii
2018-01-18 01:56:54	AlexMax	tabs
2018-01-18 01:56:56	aquanight	AlexMax: unfortunately you have no easy "general rule" in unicode
2018-01-18 01:56:59	AlexMax	cr, lf
2018-01-18 01:57:34	aquanight	sure you can go by unicode categories
2018-01-18 01:57:51	DigitalKiwi	there are classes of exploits that can only exist because of unicode
2018-01-18 01:57:54	aquanight	for that matter we already had CR and LF why did we need a line separator character?
2018-01-18 01:58:16	AlexMax	unicode is good
2018-01-18 01:58:17	aquanight	another fucking line separator character
2018-01-18 01:58:26	AlexMax	code pages suck
2018-01-18 01:58:28	aquanight	and it gets better I think there's a paragraph separator too
2018-01-18 01:58:35	AlexMax	and don't even work for some languages
2018-01-18 01:58:55	aquanight	AlexMax: I'm not disputing that, but there's a wide swath of characters that can completely fuck your layout if you don't deal with them properly

2018-01-18 01:59:13	DigitalKiwi	tbf most of the ascii control codes only exist for hardware that isn't even used or relevant and then got repurposed for network crap :/
2018-01-18 01:59:19	aquanight	and in fixed-width applications like IRC clients in a terminal...
2018-01-18 01:59:37	aquanight	double the fun if your standard font doesn't have the character and the fallback font wasn't designed for terminals
2018-01-18 01:59:49	AlexMax	have you considered that maybe text characters isn't the best thing to make an interface out of?
2018-01-18 01:59:59	aquanight	I once had an emoji render as covering like a 6x6 character area (with text either under or over it)

2018-01-18 02:02:46	aquanight	I can't even begin to imagine why but even if you set aside IRC clients, terminals remain the most flexible method of system management

2018-01-18 02:03:35	aquanight	as long as that's true this issue will remain relevant if for no other reason than because of screen/tmux, which depend on having an accurate understanding of the relationship between characters and where they end up on the screen
2018-01-18 02:03:44	[xyzzy]	tbh it's 2018 and every program should require a web server and use the browser as gui
2018-01-18 02:03:47	aquanight	which unicode fucks with
2018-01-18 02:03:49	AlexMax	oh this isn't a knock against terminals
2018-01-18 02:04:01	AlexMax	terminals are fine for system management

2018-01-18 02:04:19	AlexMax	but as an interface for an actual application, it's borderline brain-damaged
2018-01-18 02:04:19	furq	looking good AlexMax 
2018-01-18 02:04:26	aquanight	AlexMax: and remember your "interfaces aren't made with characters" next time you're in 'make menuconfig' to build a linux kernel
2018-01-18 02:04:27	DigitalKiwi	I had a really cool easter egg in clyde that I took out because tmux users kept bitching :(
2018-01-18 02:04:51	AlexMax	I haven't done that in at least a decade, and I hope to never have to do that again
2018-01-18 02:05:04	AlexMax	Why do I need to compile my own kernel
2018-01-18 02:05:08	AlexMax	does it look like I use gentoo?
2018-01-18 02:05:13	DigitalKiwi	tmux didn't handle escape codes properly ... literally every other terminal and screen worked, but not tmux
2018-01-18 02:05:28	zy]x[yz	compile somebody else's kernel
2018-01-18 02:05:28	aquanight	I still do it any time I'm running gentoo on a system. I prefer my kernels slimmed down.
2018-01-18 02:05:37	zy]x[yz	like linus's for example
2018-01-18 02:06:17	AlexMax	why

2018-01-18 02:06:28	AlexMax	the kernels that centos and debian provide out of the box seem to work just fine
2018-01-18 02:07:02	aquanight	there's something about the fact that there's piles of code that will simply never get used (because it's code for things that don't apply to the system) that irks me
2018-01-18 02:07:09	aquanight	if I have the option to, I'd rather expunge it
2018-01-18 02:07:43	aquanight	sure a lot of it is in modules, but a lot isn't (usually because it can't be)
2018-01-18 02:07:56	AlexMax	yeah i was like that too
2018-01-18 02:08:08	AlexMax	then I got a job
2018-01-18 02:08:14	AlexMax	or went to college
2018-01-18 02:08:19	AlexMax	or did something else, i forget
2018-01-18 02:08:34	aquanight	(can't be unless you want an initramfs that's massive because you need a big pile of drivers just to be able to find the damned hard drive)

2018-01-18 02:09:49	AlexMax	anyway, somebody asked me to do that eons ago
2018-01-18 02:09:55	AlexMax	and at that point, i was enlightened
2018-01-18 02:10:15	aquanight	...
2018-01-18 02:10:24	AlexMax	       mt - control magnetic tape drive operation
2018-01-18 02:10:28	aquanight	"control magnetic tape drive operation" is that what you're... yeah that
2018-01-18 02:10:47	aquanight	what in the actual does this have anything to do with?
2018-01-18 02:11:01	AlexMax	there's always going to be stupid weird bullshit on your system that is never used
2018-01-18 02:11:20	AlexMax	and trying to obsess over it is fruitless
2018-01-18 02:11:38	AlexMax	check your binary directories
2018-01-18 02:11:40	aquanight	on the hard drive I can live with
2018-01-18 02:11:45	aquanight	loaded in memory, not as much
2018-01-18 02:12:07	aquanight	and in the linux kernel if it's enabled and not a module, it is loaded. period.
2018-01-18 02:12:19	aquanight	(unsure if the kernel ever lets bits of itself be swapped out)
2018-01-18 02:13:13	aquanight	this comes back to the "unless you want an initramfs that's piled with the most basic fucking drivers all your chipset / ATA / etc drivers are hardloaded"
2018-01-18 02:13:23	aquanight	and of course the initramfs may or may not really unload either
2018-01-18 02:13:39	aquanight	so if you pile a shitload of drivers in the initramfs, they're piled up in RAM anyway

2018-01-18 02:14:12	DigitalKiwi	OH NOES!
2018-01-18 02:14:14	DigitalKiwi	ALL THAT RAM
2018-01-18 02:14:50	Humbedooh	so manie
2018-01-18 02:15:07	AlexMax	aquanight: they call that being penny wise, pound foolish
2018-01-18 02:15:12	AlexMax	why obsess over megabytes of memory
2018-01-18 02:15:16	AlexMax	when computers have gigabytes
2018-01-18 02:15:43	aquanight	              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available

2018-01-18 02:15:48	aquanight	all that mem indeed
2018-01-18 02:16:25	aquanight	although I'll gladly admit most of that is probably chrome's fault right now
2018-01-18 02:16:36	DigitalKiwi	so you with your stripped down kernel is using lots more ram!
2018-01-18 02:17:10	aquanight	DigitalKiwi: I am actually curious if there's not a way I can find out how much the kernel itself is using right now
2018-01-18 02:17:19	aquanight	I thought maybe /proc/meminfo but no
2018-01-18 02:18:05	AlexMax	so why obsess over kernel size if you don't even know how much memory the kernel is utilizing?
2018-01-18 02:18:16	AlexMax	you haven't even measured anything
2018-01-18 02:18:28	AlexMax	you've been using your gut
2018-01-18 02:19:04	AlexMax	it looks like you only have 4gb of ram, you really need 8gb for a modern desktop system
2018-01-18 02:19:18	aquanight	this is a *really* old laptop
2018-01-18 02:19:25	aquanight	like 2007 I want to say
2018-01-18 02:19:28	AlexMax	and that's not even the worst thing
2018-01-18 02:19:39	AlexMax	the worst mistake you made is using linux as a desktop operating system
2018-01-18 02:19:50	DigitalKiwi	lol
2018-01-18 02:20:11	DigitalKiwi	wasn't 2007 year of the linux desktop pretty hard?
2018-01-18 02:20:27	aquanight	AlexMax: with this laptop my choice is: linux as it is currently, or windows vista
2018-01-18 02:20:53	aquanight	it couldn't even go to 7 when that came out. forget about 10.
2018-01-18 02:21:06	aquanight	the wifi is so old I think it's draft n
2018-01-18 02:21:07	AlexMax	well, modern web browsers need RAM
2018-01-18 02:21:10	AlexMax	so
2018-01-18 02:21:15	aquanight	yes I know this.
2018-01-18 02:21:26	aquanight	I literally said most of that is probably chrome's fault
2018-01-18 02:21:30	AlexMax	you're kinda stuck, uncle buck
2018-01-18 02:21:30	DigitalKiwi	i had arch on a dell xps 15 for a long time if someone hadn't stolen it would still run great...actually it had windows 7 (came with vista) ran fine.. 4 gb ram too I think
2018-01-18 02:22:06	aquanight	DigitalKiwi: I think what kept this laptop from getting 7 was the driver support
2018-01-18 02:22:13	aquanight	which dell simply said "nope fuck that"
2018-01-18 02:22:27	aquanight	I probably could've made it work but... why?
2018-01-18 02:23:02	DigitalKiwi	didn't vista drivers work on windows 7? I can't recall for sure
2018-01-18 02:23:20	aquanight	I don't think they did 100%
2018-01-18 02:23:24	aquanight	maybe some did
2018-01-18 02:23:38	aquanight	but I think there were some major changes in at least certain hardware segments
2018-01-18 02:24:56	aquanight	I think what amazes me more than anything really is that this laptop even still *runs*
2018-01-18 02:25:50	AlexMax	You really should get a more modern machine.  CPU's have stopped getting much faster, so hardware lasts much longer these days than it used to.
2018-01-18 02:26:12	aquanight	AlexMax: I do have another far more modern machine. It's just not the one I do IRC from.
2018-01-18 02:26:17	AlexMax	My machine is 5 years old and I have no intention of getting anything newer anytime soon.
2018-01-18 02:27:21	aquanight	I actually just recently got a new tower. Which replaced a 5-year-old tower. This laptop outlasted a tower that had newer shit.
2018-01-18 02:27:38	[xyzzy]	thanks to meltdown and spectre, cpus even get slower now
2018-01-18 02:27:42	aquanight	This laptop has also outlasted an entire nexus 5 (not that that's much of a feat, the way phones are)
2018-01-18 02:28:35	aquanight	(to be fair, the nexus 5 still works, just I don't do anything with it right now. Still haven't decided what to do with it. I could make *it* my IRC machine...)
2018-01-18 02:29:21	[xyzzy]	use it for iot
2018-01-18 02:30:13	aquanight	the biggest reason I finally upgraded off of it was because, again, lack of OS update support
2018-01-18 02:30:18	aquanight	it never got nougat
2018-01-18 02:30:34	aquanight	I think even the security updates stopped, short of fixing that one bluetooth exploit
2018-01-18 02:31:12	aquanight	I had cyanogen on it for a while but that doesn't exist anymore
2018-01-18 02:32:28	aquanight	speaking of android: I'm increasingly of the opinion that android might be the right model for attempting a *real* "desktop linux" if ever anyone decided to attempt it
2018-01-18 02:33:32	aquanight	I'd say google has the stones to do it but they're too busy with ChromeOS
2018-01-18 02:34:02	DigitalKiwi	my chromebook doesn't even have chromeos
2018-01-18 02:34:46	steamport	isn't google busy with Fuschia right now
2018-01-18 02:35:33	hydraz	yeah, that's why android is unmaintained
2018-01-18 02:35:34	hydraz	oh wait

This is useful, for example, to avoid configuring color values within the i3 configuration. Instead, the values can be configured, once, in the X resource database to achieve an easily maintainable, consistent color theme across many X applications.

2018-01-18 05:54:24	neffi	prefab layouts are the worst way you could do tiling

2018-01-18 05:55:38	furq	and then each of those tiles has a big fucking gap around the sides so that you can post your desktop to gentooforums.co

2018-01-19 21:25:49	ArRay_	« 19:06 <vital> how do you guys handle following situation: I have my gamemap as a 2d array indexed [i][j]. At many places I want to keep information for some of these elements, but not all » ← if something is nil then it won't take any space in memory
2018-01-19 21:25:57	ArRay_	so you can keep your 2d indexed array
2018-01-19 21:26:17	ArRay_	(sorry if I didn't understand what you're asking)
2018-01-19 21:27:32	BCB	Bone  errorno.h is a standard c header.  Seems to be missing.  I'm currently trying this solution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42777424/visual-studio-2017-errors-on-standard-headers#42778079
2018-01-19 21:27:59	zy]x[yz	errorno.h is not a standard c hearder
2018-01-19 21:28:03	zy]x[yz	lol hearder
2018-01-19 21:29:11	bone	BCB: did you read what i said at all?
2018-01-19 21:29:17	bone	you probably don't have your compiler environment correct.
2018-01-19 21:29:42	BCB	zy]x[yz: errno.h
2018-01-19 21:30:14	BCB	bone: yes.  I'm using the msvc command prompt
2018-01-19 21:30:20	vital	ArRay_, so I initialize the whole array with nils?
2018-01-19 21:30:38	ArRay_	vital: if an element doesn't exist in a table, it will be nil
2018-01-19 21:30:47	ArRay_	% local t={} print(t[3])
2018-01-19 21:30:49	yalb	ArRay_: nil
2018-01-19 21:30:53	ArRay_	vital: ^
2018-01-19 21:30:59	vital	but I have to at least initialize arr[i] for all i that I need
2018-01-19 21:31:08	ArRay_	yes
2018-01-19 21:31:11	vital	because if not it will fail when I access arr[i][j]
2018-01-19 21:31:12	ArRay_	but you don't need to add nils
2018-01-19 21:31:15	vital	or should I do that with metatables?
2018-01-19 21:31:30	BCB	bone: i'm not familiar with msvc .  trying to figure that out now
2018-01-19 21:31:42	ArRay_	you can do (arr[i] or {})[j]
2018-01-19 21:32:10	vital	oh that is a nice trick allthough I don't want that all over my code
2018-01-19 21:32:20	vital	ok thank you very much ArRay_ 
2018-01-19 21:33:28	ArRay_	(this is from PiL)
2018-01-19 21:35:24	vital	ArRay_, can you tell me which chapter that is approximatly?
2018-01-19 21:35:35	ArRay_	I'll try to find it
2018-01-19 21:35:43	ArRay_	it's about ?.stuff in C# I think
2018-01-19 21:35:49	ArRay_	and how you can do that in lua instead
2018-01-19 21:36:01	vital	ah ok yeah I didn't read up until there
2018-01-19 21:36:21	vital	I mostly read the chapter on metatables, coroutines etc are done
2018-01-19 21:36:26	vital	so mostly only part 1
2018-01-19 21:36:29	ArRay_	vital: 5.5
2018-01-19 21:36:34	ArRay_	(I found it instantly, I'm lucky today)
2018-01-19 21:36:47	ArRay_	this is the fourth edition
2018-01-19 21:36:55	ArRay_	vital: what edition do you have?
2018-01-19 21:37:03	vital	this: https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html
2018-01-19 21:37:13	vital	there is no 5.5
2018-01-19 21:37:46	vital	do you have a paper book at home?
2018-01-19 21:37:51	ArRay_	vital: that's the first edition
2018-01-19 21:37:53	ArRay_	yes
2018-01-19 21:37:57	ArRay_	I have the fourth one
2018-01-19 21:38:03	vital	oh then you are living the dream :D
2018-01-19 21:38:50	vital	ah oh that is bad
2018-01-19 21:39:03	vital	maybe I'll buy one if I stay with lua for a few months

2018-01-19 22:24:29	vital	should I prefer having a global variable (e.g. CHUNKSIZE, representing how big one subpart of the gamemap is) or make a copy of that variable in each table that uses it?
2018-01-19 22:25:00	vital	for example CHUNKSIZE is really needed nearly everywhere, but if I would like to have no globals, I would have to pass it in each object and always have a self.chunksize available
2018-01-19 22:25:05	vital	what is considered better style?
2018-01-19 22:25:31	q66	Salvakiya: at very least when require() would error (module not found, the module itself errored, etc)
2018-01-19 22:25:40	q66	it'd insert that loader but not remove it

2018-01-19 22:43:15	jdarnley	vital: if you don't want a global then can you do a local at the file scope?
2018-01-19 22:45:27	vital	well the example I had in mind was a variable which nearly all of my modules will need
2018-01-19 22:45:48	vital	it is more of a best practice question: have one global or pass it into the constructor of all of my tables
2018-01-19 22:46:48	ArRay_	vital: is it in multiple files?
2018-01-19 22:46:49	jdarnley	"best practice" is a tricky phrase here
2018-01-19 22:47:10	jdarnley	for a module anyone might use in any situation you don't want to use a global
2018-01-19 22:47:25	vital	ArRay_, yes it is like a very basic parameter describing my world (something like WORLD_WIDTH)
2018-01-19 22:47:34	jdarnley	if you control the whole program then I see no reason not to use one.
2018-01-19 22:47:36	vital	I'd say I need it in 90% of my modules until now
2018-01-19 22:48:13	RhodiumToad	make the variable it's own module, and require it when needed?
2018-01-19 22:48:20	ArRay_	I don't really know how your code works, but maybe you can put this in your module table
2018-01-19 22:49:14	RhodiumToad	i.e.  local WORLD_WIDTH = require 'myapp.constant.world_width'   where the module just returns a number
2018-01-19 22:49:40	RhodiumToad	(though this is in effect storing the value in package.loaded as a global...)
2018-01-19 22:50:49	Salvakiya	q66 ooo good point
2018-01-19 22:51:40	vital	hmm yeah well then I can also just use a global I guess
2018-01-19 22:51:53	vital	but I somehow think I probably should put it in all of the module tables
2018-01-19 22:52:16	vital	at least that way around it is easier to exchange it for a global later then if I have a global flying around and want to get rid of it
2018-01-19 22:52:19	vital	but who knows
2018-01-19 22:52:23	vital	thanks for all the input

2018-01-20 22:20:45	davisdude	You're watching an outdated tutorial. In 0.10.0, constants were switched from letters to numbers. Change "l" to 1

2018-01-20 22:28:47	davisdude	roy: Think about it: in the shoot function, `ent.Die` must be true for the entity to be hit. Try commenting out the line with `if ent.Die` and the corresponding `end`
2018-01-20 22:28:58	davisdude	See what happens
2018-01-20 22:29:24	roy	ok 1 sec
2018-01-20 22:30:10	davisdude	Additionally, your or statement is wrong. 'if ent.type == "enemy" or "enemy2" or "enemy3" or "enemy4"' only checks if the entity is type "enemy". You need to do "ent.type == "enemy" or ent.type == "enemy2", etc.
2018-01-20 22:30:26	roy	oke

2018-01-20 22:47:08	roy	hmm
2018-01-20 22:47:50	davisdude	In other words, at the end of ent:draw add "love.graphics.setColor( 255, 0, 0 )" and "love.graphics.rectangle( 'line', ent.x, ent.y, 256*(ent.size/20), 512*(ent.size/20) )

2018-01-21 07:50:35	Horizonmind	are there any good resources for beginner/intermediate level Lua users on how to divide your project into modules? I know the basics, but I think my modules are too broad and contain a bit too much code so they're getting kinda messy
2018-01-21 07:52:01	zash	Horizonmind: Somewhere between one line per file and everything in one.
2018-01-21 07:54:09	Horizonmind	sure :D but I'm talking about different ways of dividing my stuff into modules apart from that "putting a .lua file into my root, then requiring it in the loading phase"
2018-01-21 07:57:06	zash	doesn't this apply to all programming?
2018-01-21 07:57:18	Horizonmind	sure
2018-01-21 07:58:14	Horizonmind	but since I know Lua better than other languages and I'm uncertain of how much this stuff is universal and how much of it is specific to Lua
2018-01-21 07:58:49	zash	fairly universal I imagine
2018-01-21 07:58:57	zash	can't really remember reading anything about it tho
2018-01-21 07:59:03	Horizonmind	ok
2018-01-21 08:00:12	zash	altho, I suppose things like MVC might count

2018-01-21 22:28:40	zy]x[yz	but I can't program
2018-01-21 22:28:45	furq	i'm sorry to hear that
2018-01-21 22:29:53	LordRyan	can't you just rebind them in the config
2018-01-21 22:30:18	zy]x[yz	you can rebind what keys focus up/down/left/right, but you can't rebind what those things mean
2018-01-21 22:30:42	zy]x[yz	I bet you could come up with an elaborate script that gets executed and achieves it, but that sounds like a lot of work
2018-01-21 22:31:37	zy]x[yz	also with wmii I never had a systray and now that I do I don't like where i3bar puts it and there's no way to change that
2018-01-21 22:31:41	furq	does up and down work in stacked mode
2018-01-21 22:31:45	zy]x[yz	yes
2018-01-21 22:31:55	furq	that seems pretty dumb that it doesn't work in tabbed mode then
2018-01-21 22:32:06	zy]x[yz	well left and right don't work in stacked mode
2018-01-21 22:32:23	LordRyan	well you can change the bar from top to bottom
2018-01-21 22:32:31	LordRyan	unless you mean the systray inside of the i3bar
2018-01-21 22:32:34	zy]x[yz	yeah
2018-01-21 22:32:45	zy]x[yz	I want it to be on the left of the status_command
2018-01-21 22:33:01	LordRyan	maybe lemonbar lets you do that?
2018-01-21 22:33:06	zy]x[yz	because why would I ever want stuff in the systray to change the position of my clock
2018-01-21 22:33:09	furq	i like where it is and i didn't know you couldn't change it
2018-01-21 22:33:13	furq	that is pretty dumb
2018-01-21 22:33:34	LordRyan	oh wait no lemonbar just is pretty dumb overall

2018-01-22 01:08:10	shuji	i tried both path and cpath

2018-02-06 19:45:56	daurnimator	(at least from my freenode node)
2018-02-06 19:46:11	LordRyan	on my side, I sent it first, but w/e

2018-02-06 19:47:13	furq	congratulations daurnimator 
2018-02-06 19:47:23	daurnimator	I winrar.
2018-02-06 19:47:34	zy]x[yz	but I'm still right
2018-02-06 19:47:43	LordRyan	yes
2018-02-06 19:48:17	LordRyan	but you're right in the way that you can also say, "if you soak yourself in water, you become not dry"
2018-02-06 19:48:40	RhodiumToad	so I have an odd question
2018-02-06 19:48:46	LordRyan	as usual
2018-02-06 19:48:47	furq	so he's generally right then
2018-02-06 19:49:11	daurnimator	RhodiumToad: please continue :P
2018-02-06 19:49:17	RhodiumToad	from C code, is there anywhere to store a reference to a lua value in such a way that I can later store a nil there in a way that can't possibly throw an error
2018-02-06 19:49:24	zy]x[yz	my answer is entirely helpful if the question was "how can I soak myself in water to become not dry?"
2018-02-06 19:49:53	daurnimator	RhodiumToad: sure; luaL_ref and luaL_unref serve such a purpose.

2018-02-06 19:50:06	furq	RhodiumToad: by "can't possibly throw an error" do you mean from code that expects there to be a value there
2018-02-06 19:50:10	furq	because in that case no
2018-02-06 19:50:16	daurnimator	RhodiumToad: setting a table key to nil with a rawset does not allocate memory
2018-02-06 19:50:36	furq	that seems like a more likely reading
2018-02-06 19:51:17	RhodiumToad	furq: I mean the code that stores the nil must not be able to throw an error (requiring that it must not do any garbage collection, either)
2018-02-06 19:51:33	furq	well yeah, what daurnimator said
2018-02-06 19:51:48	daurnimator	RhodiumToad: the thing to ensure is that your table *key* doesn't require memory allocation (which rules out string-keys not kept away in an upvalue): use integers for 5.1 compat; or lightuserdata in 5.3
2018-02-06 19:51:54	RhodiumToad	I noticed that rawset to overwrite an existing key looked like it wouldn't allocate anything. but not sure how reliable the assumption that it won't ever throw is
2018-02-06 19:52:05	RhodiumToad	since rawset is documented as being able to throw errors
2018-02-06 19:52:54	daurnimator	RhodiumToad: overwrite existing key with nil is always safe (not documented). luaL_unref is just a call to rawset of nil, however it *is* documented to always not throw :)
2018-02-06 19:52:55	furq	it's marked as only being able to throw OOM errors
2018-02-06 19:53:09	furq	which means you're safe rawsetting to nil
2018-02-06 19:53:19	RhodiumToad	there is a little more to unref than that
2018-02-06 19:53:56	daurnimator	RhodiumToad: unref also has an optimisation for key allocation; but you can ignore that without harm

2018-02-06 20:31:00	[xyzzy]	next's documentation is a goldmine for assumptions
2018-02-06 20:31:29	[xyzzy]	for example, i use it to assume it's safe to iterate over weak tables. is it really? fuck if i know
2018-02-06 20:34:41	RhodiumToad	should be
2018-02-06 20:35:37	daurnimator	RhodiumToad: I think [xyzzy] is referring to an issue where iterating over a weak table could get you a reference to a value that already had it's __gc called.
2018-02-06 20:35:54	daurnimator	I can't recall if it was fixed or not... or which very the report was against
2018-02-06 20:36:18	daurnimator	however 5.2 had a big overhaul of ephemeron tables... to I imagine it might have got fixed then?
2018-02-06 20:36:56	[xyzzy]	well... just iterating in general. i haven't actually run into that issue. but iirc js doesn't let you iterate weak maps so i figured there was probably some reason for that and such a reason could theoretically apply to lua
2018-02-06 20:37:18	RhodiumToad	documentation suggests that you can see a post-finalized object as the _key_ of an ephemeron table
2018-02-06 20:37:21	[xyzzy]	but then again, next allows you to remove keys during iteration and weak tables are basically just automatic key removal so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2018-02-06 20:37:32	daurnimator	[xyzzy]: js doesn't let you iterate weak maps because JS doesn't want to let you know if something has been collected or not
2018-02-06 20:37:44	RhodiumToad	see the last bit of 2.5.2 in the manual
2018-02-06 20:38:01	daurnimator	[xyzzy]: weak maps in JS only allow weak keys; not weak values

2018-02-06 20:40:46	RhodiumToad	not the JS thing, I mean the handling of weak keys
2018-02-06 20:41:31	daurnimator	RhodiumToad: 5.1 ephemeron tables are a pain. I doubt anyone ever uses them correctly
2018-02-06 20:41:43	RhodiumToad	no, I mean in 5.3
2018-02-06 20:41:52	RhodiumToad	"They are removed from weak values before running their finalizers, but are removed from weak keys only in the next collection after running their finalizers,"

2018-02-07 19:37:12	furq	my favourite is where you click just between the border of two items on the start menu and the menu stays open for a few more seconds

2018-02-07 19:38:16	zy]x[yz	starting with vista the start menu feedback has been absolutely terrible.  I launch things multiple times all the time because I click it and seemingly nothign happens and the start menu isn't dismissed so I figure it didn't register the click, so I click it again and then 10 minutes later 8 of them open

2018-02-08 01:38:19	jenia	if I do Myobject { counter = 0, count = function() {counter = counter + 1}}
2018-02-08 01:38:30	jenia	is counter a global variable?
2018-02-08 01:38:43	jenia	or is it defined only in the scope of MyObject?

2018-02-08 01:50:53	jenia	yea... thanks :)
2018-02-08 01:51:25	jenia	zy]x[yz, is the function "count" also global then?
2018-02-08 01:51:34	jenia	(if it were defined correctly)
2018-02-08 01:56:27	furq	no

2018-02-08 01:58:41	jenia	furq, I mean suppose I define myObject { counter = 0, f = function() end}
2018-02-08 01:58:45	jenia	counter is global right?
2018-02-08 01:58:49	jenia	is f also global?

One of them was not in the language itself, but in the process of language development: We decided that we should always try to improve the language, even at the cost of small incompatibilities with previous versions.

2018-02-08 11:48:51	jdarnley	On the other hand if more people were using Lua in more contexts then perhaps the devs might have been persuaded to make fewer breaking changes.  Or at least giving them major version bumps.

2018-02-08 13:32:38	RhodiumToad	what issues mainly come up? (just curious)
2018-02-08 13:33:36	mbalmer_	The only issue that did bite us was the introduction of numerical subtypes.

2018-02-08 13:34:48	mbalmer_	Other systems evolve, too.  PostgreSQL also had incompatible changes in the past, so did X11...
2018-02-08 13:35:54	RhodiumToad	some pg changes have been done over a pretty extended period of time, though, e.g. migrating to standard_conforming_strings
2018-02-08 13:36:22	RhodiumToad	that took something like 6 years
2018-02-08 13:36:52	RhodiumToad	on the other hand, removing the default casts to text was done in one hit
2018-02-08 13:39:57	mbalmer_	just two days ago I had to adapt a touchscreen driver to X.Org xserver 1.19 (which RHEL/CentOS uses while Ubuntu still uses 1.18)

2018-02-08 18:46:05	silver1	when you say "is X a thing" in US, it means something specific

2018-02-08 19:45:38	jackprob	I don't know what that means
2018-02-08 19:47:15	wward	you are messing up your contents to begin with
2018-02-08 19:47:37	bone	you overwrite contents, presumably parse() returns a table.
2018-02-08 19:48:09	bone	given that you access it as contents.directory.
2018-02-08 19:48:23	RhodiumToad	the two calls to json.decode look suspicious
2018-02-08 19:48:25	wward	And later on again try to json.decode(contents)
2018-02-08 19:48:46	wward	which is a table at that moment
2018-02-08 19:49:05	wward	just call it file_contents
2018-02-08 19:49:15	wward	and make the other contents local too
2018-02-08 19:49:39	wward	But decoding the same string twice does not really help though :-)
2018-02-08 19:49:40	jackprob	ah damn I called it twice right
2018-02-08 19:49:57	jackprob	yes sorry guys that was a stupid mistake
2018-02-08 19:50:08	jackprob	the overwriting is not by accident, I don't need the string anymore
2018-02-08 19:50:15	wward	ah, ok :-)
2018-02-08 19:50:19	jackprob	but calling it twice was by accident :D thank you :)
2018-02-08 19:51:21	wward	You know you can also just load lua code... If you are the one making the file....
2018-02-08 19:51:25	 *	wward just dumps lua code
2018-02-08 19:51:33	wward	and I read it back in again
2018-02-08 19:52:03	jackprob	my work process is: single images with a json file I wrote ===> python script by me makes spritesheet ===> lua reads json
2018-02-08 19:52:17	jackprob	and emitting json from python is easier then lua code I guess
2018-02-08 19:52:37	jackprob	(the python also creates a new json file/modifies my stuff)
2018-02-08 19:53:19	jackprob	I would consider moving the whole spritesheetcreation etc to lua at some point but I don't know any libraries there yet (are there good ones?) whereas in python I have pillow which makes it pretty easy
2018-02-08 19:59:16	bone	there are certainly libraries that serialize lua tables to json.
2018-02-08 19:59:34	bone	but what spritesheetcreation is, i don't know.
2018-02-08 19:59:55	furq	it's thecreationofspritesheets
2018-02-08 20:00:29	jackprob	:D basically I'd need a library to easily do image manipulation
2018-02-08 20:00:47	jackprob	paste smaller images into bigger images, read pixel values and change color of specific pixels etc
2018-02-08 20:01:13	jackprob	bone: if you have a 2d game then you normally put all of the graphics into one image, the graphics are called sprites and the one image is called sprite sheet
2018-02-08 20:01:25	jackprob	that can then be loaded by the graphics card etc s.t. you can draw from that image
2018-02-08 20:01:25	zash	heh, last time I was going to do image stuff in lua, I ended up with luajit and a big ffi array as a frame buffer
2018-02-08 20:01:51	jackprob	:D:D maybe I'll stick to python for the image stuff then
2018-02-08 20:03:03	bone	i'd say don't fix what isn't broken.
2018-02-08 20:04:52	zash	I'd say, if someone says "don't fix what isn't broken", double check if it's actually broken or not
2018-02-08 20:04:58	bone	there are certainly binding to things like imagemagick and others, but the work you're doing in python may not directly translate, you'd probably have to write a bunch of code.
2018-02-08 20:05:14	zash	the number of times people have said that about the worst horribly broken things from hell, ... ugh
2018-02-08 20:05:36	bone	it's a bit cliche, but applies in his situation.
2018-02-08 20:05:52	zash	but the state of lua graphics lib bindings wasn't that great when I looked some months ago
2018-02-08 20:06:05	bone	this has nothing to do with lua graphics lib bindings.
2018-02-08 20:06:15	bone	he already said he has working things in python.
2018-02-08 20:06:46	zash	yeah, so replacing it with lua isn't a great idea :)

2018-02-09 23:55:23	fooman2011_	Hello. I'm using lua 5.3. I have 2 lua files "A" and "B". Into "A" there is a "require("B")" and into "B" there is a "require("A")". When I do this I get the error: too many C levels (limit is 200) in function at line...  Could you please tell me where this error comes from ?
2018-02-09 23:56:00	furq	it's from the circular require you just mentioned
2018-02-09 23:56:00	LordRyan	because A loads B, then B loads A, then A loads B, and so on.
2018-02-09 23:56:41	fooman2011_	Yeah ok, So circular require is not supported ?
2018-02-09 23:57:04	LordRyan	no, it's not
2018-02-09 23:57:08	fooman2011_	I think that circular require is not a correct architecture. But the error displayed is not very clear
2018-02-09 23:57:33	fooman2011_	Anyaway ok. Thanks for your answer

2018-02-10 22:51:10	ArRay_	zumba_addict: you can't do this with webchat
2018-02-10 22:51:25	ArRay_	you can put your password before it even connects to freenode though
2018-02-10 22:51:25	zumba_addict	what do you mean ArRay_?
2018-02-10 22:51:34	ArRay_	I meant zy]x[yz 
2018-02-10 22:51:43	ArRay_	tab completion fail

2018-02-10 22:52:42	ArRay_	but I didn't get what you meant…
2018-02-10 22:52:51	ArRay_	the part with “convert”
2018-02-10 22:52:59	furq	i assume convert was meant to be confirm
2018-02-10 22:53:09	furq	but yeah the question depends on what you want to encode to and decode from
2018-02-10 22:53:14	furq	the answer is probably yes anyway
2018-02-10 22:53:31	ArRay_	zumba_addict: do you have an example in another programming language?
2018-02-10 22:53:50	zumba_addict	none yet. Let me write one. Give me few mins. Thanks a lot :)

2018-02-10 23:00:44	zumba_addict	it works
2018-02-10 23:01:15	furq	if you're asking if lua can encode to base64 then yes of course it can

2018-02-10 23:02:35	zumba_addict	i'll need to search for the nginx lua module
2018-02-10 23:02:41	zumba_addict	oh there you go :)
2018-02-10 23:02:53	zumba_addict	you are amazing!
2018-02-10 23:03:08	furq	thanks for noticing
2018-02-10 23:03:25	zumba_addict	I just need to adjust so that when someone can't just grab the string and use regular base64 tool
2018-02-10 23:04:09	zumba_addict	any ideas how to make it more secure? The string i'll be encoding is the version of our application which is in semver + jenkins build number
2018-02-10 23:04:12	ArRay_	zumba_addict: you want encryption?
2018-02-10 23:04:16	zumba_addict	not really
2018-02-10 23:04:35	ArRay_	you want something that encodes some data but without explaining how to decode it?
2018-02-10 23:04:35	zumba_addict	just a basic encoding that I'll be able to decode/encode
2018-02-10 23:04:44	ArRay_	security through obscurity doesn't really work
2018-02-10 23:04:52	zumba_addict	i quite agree
2018-02-10 23:05:06	zumba_addict	ok, if it's encryption, how is it done?
2018-02-10 23:05:15	zumba_addict	but wait, let me explain what I'm doing
2018-02-10 23:05:15	ArRay_	you could use lua-lockbox

2018-02-10 23:07:00	zumba_addict	I recently built an nginx with lua support on my laptop to try the stuff we are talking about now. Currently, our nginx has rules which sees cookie and grabs the value and uses it as part of the path in proxy_pass
2018-02-10 23:07:50	zumba_addict	like proxy_pass http://someserveer/path/1.2.3.45/app
2018-02-10 23:08:43	zumba_addict	it's working great! Now I'd like to hide or mask or encrypt/encode 1.2.3.45 so that anyone playing with cookies won't be able to easily guess. It still doesn't hurt if they're lucky to find 1.2.3.40 working
2018-02-10 23:09:45	ArRay_	so they also need to encode the data?
2018-02-10 23:09:46	ArRay_	and you decode it?
2018-02-10 23:09:56	zumba_addict	nginx just decoding
2018-02-10 23:10:11	zumba_addict	the encoding is done by manually by us and it doesn't change often
2018-02-10 23:11:32	ArRay_	ok
2018-02-10 23:11:45	ArRay_	if the data is THAT sensitive you can probably use encryption
2018-02-10 23:11:46	zumba_addict	we have a system where we enter the 1.2.3.45. It's in a tomcat server. When users visits the site, that tomcat sends 1.2.3.45 as a cookie. THe user receives it, and when user makes another call, the nginx sees it
2018-02-10 23:12:09	ArRay_	so only you have access to the machines where encoding and decoding is done?
2018-02-10 23:12:10	zumba_addict	it's not really sensitive but I think it's a nice layer to make it more secure
2018-02-10 23:12:14	zumba_addict	yes
2018-02-10 23:12:24	ArRay_	then you only need something like AES
2018-02-10 23:12:31	zumba_addict	cool
2018-02-10 23:12:57	ArRay_	but if it doesn't matter you should probably leave it like this
2018-02-10 23:12:58	zumba_addict	so lua can decode AES?
2018-02-10 23:13:01	ArRay_	I mean if the data doesn't matter
2018-02-10 23:13:20	ArRay_	zumba_addict: https://github.com/somesocks/lua-lockbox
2018-02-10 23:13:23	zumba_addict	cool
2018-02-10 23:13:27	zumba_addict	checking it out now
2018-02-10 23:13:36	ArRay_	this is done only in lua
2018-02-10 23:13:47	ArRay_	but you could use bindings to openssl too
2018-02-10 23:14:07	zumba_addict	got it
2018-02-10 23:14:39	zumba_addict	i'll need to find something that won't have effect on performance in terms of decoding
2018-02-10 23:15:16	ArRay_	if you want as much speed as you can you should probably use bindings to a crypto library
2018-02-10 23:15:59	zumba_addict	interesting. It's way over my head right now but can you please explain how it's done?
2018-02-10 23:16:28	zy]x[yz	ArRay_, oh, well web client people are second-class citizens anyway
2018-02-10 23:16:34	ArRay_	the bindings are already done, you just load them and use the functions/objects/…
2018-02-10 23:16:51	zumba_addict	got it. Is it from the same link you gave me?

2018-02-12 01:25:02	RhodiumToad	steamport: the sort output you showed is sorting _maps before code, which seems like it should only be possible if LC_COLLATE is not C
2018-02-12 01:25:26	steamport	how would i setlocale?
2018-02-12 01:25:58	RhodiumToad	os.setlocale
2018-02-12 01:26:08	steamport	what should i set it to
2018-02-12 01:26:09	RhodiumToad	I'm not suggesting you should, I'm asking if you did

2018-02-12 01:28:45	steamport	i didn't use setlocale
2018-02-12 01:28:57	RhodiumToad	anyway, you can get the result you want using a comparison function for sort
2018-02-12 01:29:32	RhodiumToad	you want more deeply nested files to come after their parent directory contents?

2018-02-12 01:59:57	RhodiumToad	the logic is: compare a component at a time; if one string ends after comparing equal components, the longer string is larger
2018-02-12 02:00:13	RhodiumToad	if a component differs, then the one ending in / or \ is larger
2018-02-12 02:00:25	RhodiumToad	otherwise go by the order of the component

2018-02-12 22:07:22	madduck	I need to craft a conditional on the current timezone, e.g. if tz == "Pacific/Auckland" then … ideally this would be a datetime-like compare, but I guess I could go with a string compare. However, I can't quite figure out where to get the local timezone from…
2018-02-12 22:07:26	madduck	how would you do this in lua?
2018-02-12 22:08:04	madduck	i mean, there is os.date(), but that would mean string compare AFAICT
2018-02-12 22:08:42	zy]x[yz	lua doesn't have any builtin facilities for special timezone treatment

2018-02-12 22:25:46	madduck	i am not qualified to speak on that. we just said "cheers to you", so for all i care, it was "you"

2018-02-12 22:29:17	LordRyan	daurnimator: i think it was supposed to be getting the current timezone, rather than converting a timezone to an object
2018-02-12 22:30:37	zy]x[yz	that's how it started, but then later he said something about not being able to get the time in another timezone

2018-02-12 23:39:17	whizzl	it was just a passing thought hehe
2018-02-12 23:40:00	bone	take a gander through the code people write for it... more likely than not it is going to be a bunch of positioning and event handling, nothing terribly interesting.
2018-02-12 23:42:50	whizzl	fair enough! im currently learning it by messing around with love2d. I thought about looking into modding games but have only really heard of garry's mod or WoW that make it particularly easy to do so

2018-02-13 11:28:35	mchl_nix	Hey. I noticed, that my version of Lua 5.2.4 shows weird behaviour with math.atan.
2018-02-13 11:29:46	mchl_nix	If you use a current version (5.3.4) online here: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_lua_online.php and type in "print(math.atan(494.25, 508,75))" you get the correct value (0.77.....)
2018-02-13 11:30:39	mchl_nix	But if you do it with an older version: https://repl.it/repls/HumbleHoneydewComputerscience (here Lua 5.1) it gives you the wrong answer (1.5......)
2018-02-13 11:31:03	mchl_nix	I couldn't find anything about this behaviour online or on the bug page. Does anyone know what is going on?

2018-02-13 23:11:04	jacquessasda	I'm sorry to bother u, but I can't figure out what's I'm wrong
2018-02-13 23:11:11	jacquessasda	this code:       notes = {"do", "re", "mi", "fa", "sol", "la", "si"}      for k, v in ipairs(notes) do     table.insert(notes, v .. "b")     end  print(notes)
2018-02-13 23:11:39	Habbie	please pastebin a full but short failing program
2018-02-13 23:12:04	jacquessasda	http://rextester.com/CXZS4970
2018-02-13 23:12:26	Habbie	ok, and what's wrong?
2018-02-13 23:12:48	jacquessasda	the problem is simple : I want to have a big table with "do, do#, dob, re, re#, reb, mi, mi#, mid .... etc"
2018-02-13 23:13:01	jacquessasda	musical notes..
2018-02-13 23:13:02	Habbie	ah
2018-02-13 23:13:08	Habbie	but you are extending the table you are iterating
2018-02-13 23:13:16	Habbie	you should insert into a second table
2018-02-13 23:13:27	jacquessasda	oh
2018-02-13 23:13:34	jacquessasda	ok, ill try
2018-02-13 23:13:36	jacquessasda	thz
2018-02-13 23:13:38	Habbie	this is an infinite loop it looks like
2018-02-13 23:13:46	Habbie	don't you want dob before do, btw?
2018-02-13 23:14:32	jacquessasda	it's not so important
2018-02-13 23:14:36	Habbie	ok
2018-02-13 23:14:40	Habbie	just checking :)
2018-02-13 23:14:43	jacquessasda	yeah but if I'd like
2018-02-13 23:14:52	jacquessasda	how can I do?
2018-02-13 23:15:09	Habbie	let's take this one step at a time
2018-02-13 23:15:22	Habbie	make a new table so you avoid the infinite loop
2018-02-13 23:15:26	Habbie	then we can make it better
2018-02-13 23:15:50	jacquessasda	let me try

2018-02-13 23:38:37	jacquessasda	so I'm writing a little code in Lua so I can leave it for the future
2018-02-13 23:38:44	Habbie	next up: chord generation? :)
2018-02-13 23:39:38	jacquessasda	yup maype
2018-02-13 23:39:57	Habbie	i bet there's a (la)tex module for writing out bars
2018-02-13 23:40:20	jacquessasda	yeah I heard about it
2018-02-13 23:40:36	Habbie	last i looked at that was >10 years ago and i remember finding it too much work

2018-02-13 23:41:49	jacquessasda	I use finale for that cos it's pretty easy to set the score and then print it

2018-02-13 23:54:34	LordRyan	i think, for science, we need to see how many instruments before there's a flat out ban on all instruments

2018-02-14 04:01:17	furq	this is some real ugly code
2018-02-14 04:01:50	furq	normally that wouldn't do anything at the top level of a module but i'm assuming this is supposed to be loaded with loadfile or dofile
2018-02-14 04:01:59	furq	in which case it'll call it with the arguments that were passed to loadfile

2018-02-14 04:03:35	pandb	what does it mean when a function is defined like: 'local load load = function()'
2018-02-14 04:03:40	pandb	why is load there twice
2018-02-14 04:03:45	furq	it's so you can call it recursively
2018-02-14 04:03:49	pandb	ohh
2018-02-14 04:03:51	furq	it's the same as local load; load = function()
2018-02-14 04:03:53	pandb	I remember 
2018-02-14 04:03:56	furq	but you could also just do local function load()

2018-02-14 04:04:37	furq	actually nvm i guess he is calling it recursively

2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[03:01:50] normally that wouldn't do anything at the top level of a module but i'm assuming this is supposed to be loaded with loadfile or dofile
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[03:01:59] in which case it'll call it with the arguments that were passed to loadfile
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[03:02:04] or er
2018-02-14 18:31:25	pandb	[03:02:05] Ah, thanks
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[03:02:07] dofile
2018-02-14 18:31:25	pandb	[03:03:35] what does it mean when a function is defined like: 'local load load = function()'
2018-02-14 18:31:25	pandb	[03:03:40] why is load there twice
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[03:03:45] it's so you can call it recursively
2018-02-14 18:31:25	pandb	[03:03:49] ohh
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[03:03:51] it's the same as local load; load = function()
2018-02-14 18:31:25	pandb	[03:03:53] I remember 
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[03:03:56] but you could also just do local function load()
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[03:04:18] i also don't really understand why he's bothered to make that a function
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[03:04:37] actually nvm i guess he is calling it recursively
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[03:04:48] it really shouldn't be a vararg function though
2018-02-14 18:31:25	daurnimator	[03:24:34] pandb: as furq said, it's same as writing: local function load()
2018-02-14 18:31:25	daurnimator	[03:24:48] no idea why you'd write it that way. looks terrible :P
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[03:41:05] daurnimator: presumably for consistency with the rest of the code
2018-02-14 18:31:25	pandb	[05:23:54] daurnimator: didn't write it myself. should be clear from the context
2018-02-14 18:31:25	pandb	[05:24:08] perhaps english is your second language
2018-02-14 18:31:25	pandb	[05:24:18] or third ;)
2018-02-14 18:31:25	pandb	[05:25:11] "hey guys can you help me understand this line of code that I wrote and would presumably already understand why I did that?"
2018-02-14 18:31:25	hifi	[05:28:41] did you just turn reading comprehension into an insult
2018-02-14 18:31:25	pandb	[05:31:38] Just correcting someone who unduly gave me credit for some code that wasn't to his liking
2018-02-14 18:31:25	ttmrichter	[05:44:26] furq: You REALLY need to get some new material: http://goodriddlesnow.com/jokes/by/laffy-taffy-jokes/page:1/sort:popularity/direction:desc
2018-02-14 18:31:25	[xyzzy]	[06:17:35] furq's jokes really are bad
2018-02-14 18:31:25	ttmrichter	[10:06:59] [xyzzy]: I know, right?
2018-02-14 18:31:25	zy]x[yz	[12:22:33] good article furq https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/time-traveller-who-claims-hes-12018851
2018-02-14 18:31:25	RhodiumToad	[12:27:11] someone once did a search for time travellers by looking to see whether anyone had googled certain major incidents before they'd actually happened
2018-02-14 18:31:25	zy]x[yz	[12:33:00] and then they were killed in a mysterious accident?
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[14:30:38] He also say in 2030 the president is (what sounds like through the muffled dialogue) "Ilana Remikee" - who just not seem to come up in any searches.
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[14:30:43] this is some great editing
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[14:31:07] you'd think a marquee story such as this would have your best staff working on it
2018-02-14 18:31:25	zy]x[yz	[14:39:16] yes
2018-02-14 18:31:25	cehteh	[14:45:24] so furq give up your presedency plans :D
2018-02-14 18:31:25	zy]x[yz	[14:46:38] also I like that it's a british publication but still they just call it "the president"
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[15:19:18] well it's on their website
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[15:19:24] i can't imagine this made it into the actual paper
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[15:19:50] so i assume they're expecting most of the people who are credulous enough to link this shit will be american
2018-02-14 18:31:25	ttmrichter	[15:21:44] Man, your newspaper is impressive, Furq.
2018-02-14 18:31:25	ttmrichter	[15:21:58] I think the Mirror wins hands-down as my future news source.
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[15:22:08] well great news
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[15:22:12] the mirror just bought the express
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[15:22:21] that's a real clash of the titans there
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[15:22:59] i expect next week they'll have a time traveller who comes back to tell us that princess diana has come back to live and she causes cancer
2018-02-14 18:31:25	furq	[15:23:06] f

2018-02-14 21:42:42	steamport	csleep = cqueues.sleep
2018-02-14 21:42:45	steamport	i renamed it

2018-02-14 21:49:07	steamport	no it doesn't work
2018-02-14 21:49:08	steamport	fuck
2018-02-14 21:49:40	steamport	the discord identify returns true
2018-02-14 21:50:47	daurn	Also print what recieve returns. You'd enter an infinite loop if your receive returns an error
2018-02-14 21:51:31	steamport	ok
2018-02-14 21:51:38	steamport	daurn: luajit: main.lua:278: cqueue: main.lua:236: Error while decoding payload.
2018-02-14 21:51:53	steamport	thats what happened after asserting discord_ws:receive()
2018-02-14 21:53:51	daurn	What json library are you using. I don't know any that use method calls
2018-02-14 21:54:02	steamport	errrrrrrrr
2018-02-14 21:54:41	steamport	https://github.com/jiyinyiyong/json-lua
2018-02-14 21:55:15	furq	lol
2018-02-14 21:55:26	daurn	Okay thats fine
2018-02-14 21:55:26	furq	is that the one created by the guy who hates lua and repeatedly writes blogs about how much it sucks
2018-02-14 21:56:02	steamport	btw daurn, the error doesn't occur unless i wrap discord_ws:receive() in an assert
2018-02-14 21:56:54	LordRyan	steamport: yes, that's because discord_ws:receive() uses a Lua-ism where you can either return the "success" value, or return false and an error
2018-02-14 21:57:02	LordRyan	because you don't handle the error, it just goes away silently
2018-02-14 21:57:06	steamport	oh
2018-02-14 21:57:11	steamport	local data, opcode = assert(discord_ws:receive())
2018-02-14 21:57:13	steamport	hmmm
2018-02-14 21:57:15	LordRyan	it doesn't match anything you expect it to match, so it just goes back to trying again.
2018-02-14 21:57:24	steamport	oh ok
2018-02-14 21:57:39	steamport	but why is cqueues.sleep not working
2018-02-14 21:58:25	steamport	wait
2018-02-14 21:58:28	steamport	I have a question about cqueues
2018-02-14 22:00:20	daurnimator	steamport: what is 3rd return value from :receive?
2018-02-14 22:00:46	steamport	32 spam
2018-02-14 22:00:53	steamport	it spams 32
2018-02-14 22:01:44	daurnimator	32 is EPIPE (Broken pipe)
2018-02-14 22:01:48	daurnimator	steamport: what was the first one?
2018-02-14 22:02:00	daurnimator	(the first one would have been something else not 32)
2018-02-14 22:02:37	steamport	here's what it's spamming right now

2018-02-14 22:11:15	daurnimator	what is the 2, 5 you're passing to :send?
2018-02-14 22:11:49	steamport	2 is opcode
2018-02-14 22:11:50	steamport	5 is timeout

2018-02-14 22:17:02	daurnimator	also that it has the alias: :send("foo", "text", 12345)

2018-02-14 22:21:35	daurnimator	steamport: remember to assert() anything in lua-http you don't want to handle errors for manually
2018-02-14 22:22:05	daurnimator	it's not the best pattern for newbies: but in a fully-correct application you almost always want to do something special for certain error codes
2018-02-14 22:22:53	daurnimator	https://daurnimator.github.io/lua-http/0.2/#conventions "Errors are returned as nil, error, errno unless noted otherwise." <-- take heed! means you should use assert 99% of the time.
2018-02-14 22:23:45	daurnimator	steamport: can you file a lua-http documentation bug telling me to explain the opcode bit more?
2018-02-14 22:23:55	steamport	yeah
2018-02-14 22:24:07	steamport	apparently you have to put op=x in the table for discord
2018-02-14 22:25:01	daurnimator	I will just expand the ws:send() docs to point out that it is a **websocket opcode** and that the only valid values are from the IANA opcode registry.

2018-02-15 17:14:25	alkino	hi o/
2018-02-15 17:14:44	alkino	is there any convenient library to do 64 bits bitwise arithmetic?
2018-02-15 17:14:47	alkino	I use luajit
2018-02-15 17:15:00	alkino	and number become "double" from 2^53
2018-02-15 17:15:04	RhodiumToad	doesn't luajit have one built in? or is that only 32 bit?
2018-02-15 17:15:05	alkino	I find it strange
2018-02-15 17:15:11	alkino	only 32 bits
2018-02-15 17:15:29	alkino	bit.lshift(number, shift % 32)
2018-02-15 17:15:41	alkino	the shift is module with 32
2018-02-15 17:15:54	alkino	and we cannot store 64 bits numbers
2018-02-15 17:16:13	alkino	function test(n) if n == n +1 then print("failed") end end
2018-02-15 17:16:21	alkino	test(2^53) => failed
2018-02-15 17:16:28	RhodiumToad	the luajit docs suggest that the bitops work with 64bit if you pass them 64-bit cdata values
2018-02-15 17:16:53	alkino	test(2^52+hum
2018-02-15 17:16:57	alkino	hum*
2018-02-15 17:17:09	alkino	with ffi?
2018-02-15 17:17:29	RhodiumToad	test(2LL^53)  in your example
2018-02-15 17:17:53	RhodiumToad	you can use the LL suffix to create int64_t (or ULL for uint64_t) cdata values straight from lua
2018-02-15 17:18:26	alkino	oooooooh
2018-02-15 17:18:31	alkino	I didn't know it!
2018-02-15 17:19:06	RhodiumToad	just remember that they're not really numbers so you shouldn't try and use them as table keys

2018-02-15 17:21:03	RhodiumToad	oh, that's only in the 2.1 beta?
2018-02-15 17:21:04	furq	it works in 2.1

2018-02-15 17:21:40	alkino	We got 2.0.5
2018-02-15 17:21:44	RhodiumToad	so in 2.0 it still lets you create cdatas with 1LL etc., but doesn't accept them in the bitops lib

2018-02-15 17:25:19	furq	yeah you'd specifically need something that operates on int64_t cdata
2018-02-15 17:25:25	furq	which rules out any libs for rio lua
2018-02-15 17:25:33	alkino	Is there any tips to migrate from 2.0.5 to 2.1
2018-02-15 17:25:37	furq	not really
2018-02-15 17:25:37	alkino	there is some ABI brakes
2018-02-15 17:25:43	furq	no
2018-02-15 17:25:45	RhodiumToad	yeah, trying to handle cdata via the normal lua api is basically impossible
2018-02-15 17:25:59	furq	2.1 is still in beta, so bear that in mind

2018-02-15 17:26:09	RhodiumToad	the easy way would be just to compile a handful of C functions and call them via the ffi

2018-02-15 17:29:39	alkino	https://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=luajit
2018-02-15 17:29:40	furq	i remember that being a major pain for a long time
2018-02-15 17:29:58	furq	lol
2018-02-15 17:30:00	furq	i take that as a no, then
2018-02-15 17:30:10	furq	if i'm reading that right then they've just dropped 2.0 from 26 and up
2018-02-15 17:32:10	LordRyan	i think it was Fedora but I know that one distro wouldn't let you install different Lua versions
2018-02-15 17:32:20	furq	it's all rpm distros afaik
2018-02-15 17:32:28	furq	fedora hasn't packaged 5.2 since 22
2018-02-15 17:32:46	furq	i guess it's more forgivable with luajit because it's still abi compatible
2018-02-15 17:32:55	furq	it's just weird that they're upgrading to a beta that evidently still has quite a few bugs
2018-02-15 17:36:07	alkino	the easiest will be to do a library doing 64 bits on 2 * 32 bits ?
2018-02-15 17:36:49	furq	well if you're not distributing this then the easiest thing is to just use luajit 2.1
2018-02-15 17:37:09	furq	a lot of people are already using it in production
2018-02-15 17:37:23	alkino	we have 100k+ devices in the wild
2018-02-15 17:37:34	alkino	Can I take the responsability? xD
2018-02-15 17:37:37	furq	lol

2018-02-15 17:37:49	furq	i was just typing "if you're on amd64 then i would expect it to work fine"
2018-02-15 17:37:51	furq	but i guess not eh
2018-02-15 17:38:01	alkino	aarch64
2018-02-15 17:38:10	alkino	IIRC
2018-02-15 17:38:16	bone	can't you just write a C module to do what you want?
2018-02-15 17:38:18	furq	yeah that's specifically one of the architectures that the 2.1 beta is overhauling
2018-02-15 17:38:25	furq	so that's a bigger risk
2018-02-15 17:38:41	furq	so yeah i would either just do it with two 32-bit numbers or call out to a c library
2018-02-15 17:39:25	furq	hopefully this isn't in a hot loop that's a C call will destroy the performance of
2018-02-15 17:39:28	furq	-'s
2018-02-15 17:39:35	alkino	this is every where
2018-02-15 17:39:58	Habbie	FFI C calls do not destroy performance, right?
2018-02-15 17:40:31	furq	oh yeah duh
2018-02-15 17:41:06	furq	if this is embedded then it doesn't even need to be a library, you just throw it in your host app and link with -Wl,-E
2018-02-15 17:41:55	alkino	do you have any doc about that?
2018-02-15 17:42:41	alkino	If you want to be proud we have more than 110k sloc in our embedded device
2018-02-15 17:42:53	bone	seems like you could write a C library that returns a struct back in cdata or whatever, and slap a metatable on it to call equivalent luajit functions on it to make it compatible with the newer version of luajit going forward so you wouldn't have to change a whole lot of code later.

2018-02-15 18:00:18	RhodiumToad	I _think_ you'll find that that metatable is actually shared with all cdatas 
2018-02-15 18:01:42	RhodiumToad	so modifying it is probably not anything you want to do
2018-02-15 18:02:05	alkino	is there any other cdata that ULL I can inspect?
2018-02-15 18:02:17	alkino	I don't want to modifying it in fact
2018-02-15 18:02:19	bone	yeah, you would want to construct a new type, and attach your own metatable with those metamethods.

2018-02-15 18:04:13	bone	yeah, screw the bitlib.
2018-02-15 18:04:15	RhodiumToad	it already has one, and cdatas aren't like userdatas, I think they all share one metatable rather than having their own

2018-02-15 18:04:27	bone	ah okay.
2018-02-15 18:04:34	furq	well the metatable suggestion was entirely for compatibility with 2.1 to save time in future

2018-02-15 18:05:22	RhodiumToad	(which means the lua_type() API call is not actually either API or ABI compatible between luajit and normal lua)

2018-02-15 18:09:20	RhodiumToad	what I ended up doing to support luajit cdata int64s in my code was to compile up a lua function that took a cdata arg and returned it as two numbers, upper and lower 32 bits, and stitch those back together in the C code
2018-02-15 18:09:37	bone	how win32 of you. ;)
2018-02-15 18:10:14	RhodiumToad	but that means I also had to find out what undocumented magic value lua_type() returns for cdatas
2018-02-15 18:10:31	RhodiumToad	(for which there is no #define)
2018-02-15 18:12:33	alkino	why don't you return a cdata too?
2018-02-15 18:13:04	RhodiumToad	because there's absolutely no way to either create or access cdata values through the C api

2018-02-15 18:17:06	bone	it will take less time to learn that than write a C module.

2018-02-15 21:25:31	Hijiri	is there a serialization library along the lines of C++ streams
2018-02-15 21:25:44	Hijiri	where you explicitly read and write data
2018-02-15 21:26:12	Hijiri	As opposed to just handing some function your table and it turns it into a string of some format
2018-02-15 21:29:47	Hijiri	Actually, I think it would be sufficient to just make it possible to convert primitives to binary formats (e.g. take a number and get the bytes in little endian as a string)
2018-02-15 21:30:01	furq	string.unpack
2018-02-15 21:30:04	Hijiri	then you could use a table to build the output and use table.concat

2018-02-15 23:25:29	cehteh	for the april 1 release we should make a lua where arrays start at 0.001, just because we use floats :D

2018-02-15 23:30:44	LordRyan	but what I think cehteh wanted was an easy way to iterate over a table by using "the next biggest key", which would be better solved by something like an insertion-sorted table
2018-02-15 23:31:01	[xyzzy]	yeah idk which of the three thought it was a good idea to deprecate it but they need their cheese bun and futbol privileges revoked
2018-02-15 23:32:02	cehteh	LordRyan: nop, i am thinking about some other array implementation
2018-02-15 23:32:12	LordRyan	oh
2018-02-15 23:32:28	cehteh	having something in mind maybe implementing it someday
2018-02-15 23:32:37	LordRyan	well either way, there's no reason you can't implement something yourself using a linked list of sorts
2018-02-15 23:33:02	cehteh	you want to have at least close to array like O(1) performance
2018-02-15 23:33:03	LordRyan	or basically implement whatever it is, in Lua.
2018-02-15 23:33:18	LordRyan	right
2018-02-15 23:33:26	LordRyan	but you want holes in it?
2018-02-15 23:35:35	cehteh	plan is to use a splay tree of smaller arrays, for common access patterns that should be close to normal arrays, some things like inserts/deletes in the middle even become vastly more efficient, only extremely random access is logarithmic
2018-02-15 23:36:21	cehteh	and you know the smallest/biggiest element, when there are holes, an iteration will return nil
2018-02-15 23:36:46	RhodiumToad	so no actual difference in semantics from current lua tables, just performance?
2018-02-15 23:36:52	cehteh	so unless you know better, iteration of a highly sparse array is of course not a very clever idea
2018-02-15 23:37:01	RhodiumToad	oh, except iterations returning nil
2018-02-15 23:37:12	LordRyan	maybe a table of tables
2018-02-15 23:37:18	cehteh	yes and array can start end at any number
2018-02-15 23:37:31	LordRyan	{start=x, end=y, values={...}}
2018-02-15 23:37:32	al2o3-cr	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPugdXQ09uU 
2018-02-15 23:37:56	LordRyan	well, can't use end
2018-02-15 23:38:10	cehteh	yes like that, but i dont think this as to be implemented in lua, actually i want it for something else and may port it as special userdata table back to lua
2018-02-15 23:38:17	LordRyan	but the values would be y-x amount
2018-02-15 23:38:27	LordRyan	yeah cehteh but i'm just trying to get what you mean here
2018-02-15 23:38:41	LordRyan	i think i got it though
2018-02-15 23:38:56	cehteh	well i only gave a coarse overview, details differ a bit
2018-02-15 23:39:27	cehteh	for example i am already implemented an array in c which may have *one* hole. moving things to the end
2018-02-15 23:40:24	cehteh	which copes well with the common access pattern that one inserts/deletes things somewhere inbetween without the need to move the remaining members around
2018-02-15 23:40:39	cehteh	that will be part of the algorihtm later

2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[18:49:03] the exponent being 1023+52
2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[18:49:19] (the exponent is stored in excess-1023 form
2018-02-16 20:40:47	zy]x[yz	[18:49:28] how is 0 representable with an implicit 1 msb?
2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[18:49:37] with an exponent of 0

2018-02-16 20:40:47	zy]x[yz	[18:49:47] but then that would be 1
2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[18:49:59] exponent 0 means the number is not normalized; if the fraction bits are also all 0, then the value is 0
2018-02-16 20:40:47	zy]x[yz	[18:50:07] oh
2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[18:50:21] denormalized values have exponent 0 and a non-zero fraction
2018-02-16 20:40:47	alkino	[18:51:36] oh so number in lua is still double
2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[18:51:37] and yes, the sign bit is independent of the rest of the value, so +0 and -0 are encoded differently
2018-02-16 20:40:47	alkino	[18:51:42] but denormalized double
2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[18:51:45] no

2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[18:52:07] yes, but that's not denormalized
2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[18:52:37] 1 is stored as x3ff0000000000000
2018-02-16 20:40:47	alkino	[18:52:54] I'm fucking lost
2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[18:53:16] now the evil thing that luajit does is to store everything that's _not_ a number also in ieee floats, using different NaN values
2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[18:53:39] i.e. tables, userdata, strings etc.
2018-02-16 20:40:47	alkino	[18:54:21] lol
2018-02-16 20:40:47	alkino	[18:54:39] you mean pointer on table, userdata, ...
2018-02-16 20:40:47	alkino	[18:54:41] ?
2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[18:55:10] yes
2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[18:55:22] NaN is flagged by all 1s in the exponent field
2018-02-16 20:40:47	alkino	[18:55:46] 2^11-1
2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[18:55:49] so that leaves 52 bits, of which only about 1 is needed to distinguish actual NaNs generated by the FPU from arithmetic operations
2018-02-16 20:40:47	[xyzzy]	[18:55:55] %luajit u=ffi.new'union{int64_t i;double d;}' u.i=0xfffffff400000000ull print(type(u.d))
2018-02-16 20:40:47	yalb	[18:55:55] [xyzzy]: table
2018-02-16 20:40:47	alkino	[18:55:56] so you have all the mantissa to play with
2018-02-16 20:40:47	[xyzzy]	[18:55:57] what's evil about that
2018-02-16 20:40:47	alkino	[18:56:27] lol
2018-02-16 20:40:47	alkino	[18:56:31] it's weird
2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[18:56:34] so luajit then assumes that pointers never have more than 48 or so bits of significance
2018-02-16 20:40:47	alkino	[18:56:36] thanks for that
2018-02-16 20:40:47	alkino	[18:56:49] what on 64 bits system?
2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[18:56:51] so you can fit a pointer and a type tag into the available space
2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[18:57:34] on 64-bit systems you have to use a memory allocator that always allocates lua stuff in the bottom 48 bits of address space, or bottom 32 bits if you didn't compile with the GC64 option
2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[18:58:19] it also means that you can't put the address of a value on the C stack into a lua lightuserdata, because the C stack usually starts too high up
2018-02-16 20:40:47	alkino	[18:59:32] xD
2018-02-16 20:40:47	alkino	[18:59:37] but why
2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[18:59:44] why what?
2018-02-16 20:40:47	alkino	[18:59:57] why do smth so complicated?
2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[19:00:10] why use this encoding scheme? it's obviously so that you can store any lua value in a 64-bit register and still have it be self-describing
2018-02-16 20:40:47	RhodiumToad	[19:00:48] of course it also means that luajit can't do 64-bit integers the way 5.3 does
2018-02-16 20:40:47	alkino	[19:03:06] ok

2018-02-19 17:32:49	RhodiumToad	[14:20:34] that's easy with the re module, a bit more fiddly with raw lpeg
2018-02-19 17:32:49	RhodiumToad	[14:21:12] the re module has the =name sequence which is a backreference to a named capture
2018-02-19 17:32:49	LordRyan	[14:21:45] re.compile("{:label: . :} 'foobar' =1") IIRC?
2018-02-19 17:32:49	RhodiumToad	[14:22:39] one of the examples for the re module is matching the lua [===[blah]===] comment syntax, which uses a backref to match the number of =s
2018-02-19 17:32:49	LordRyan	[14:22:47] works here
2018-02-19 17:32:49	vktec	[14:24:02] I'd much rather use LPeg directly. I've got some other bits I need to include into my pattern
2018-02-19 17:32:49	vktec	[14:24:34] I'm guessing it's going to use lpeg.Cg and lpeg.Cb, but I'm not sure how to match the result of Cb
2018-02-19 17:32:49	RhodiumToad	[14:25:34] look at how re implements it, it has to use a match-time capture (Cmt)
2018-02-19 17:32:49	RhodiumToad	[14:25:58] plus an accessory function that does "if I'm looking at exactly this text, match it, else fail"
2018-02-19 17:32:49	LordRyan	[14:26:59] vktec: Cg(P(1), "label") * P"foobar" * Cb"label"
2018-02-19 17:32:49	LordRyan	[14:27:02] ?
2018-02-19 17:32:49	vktec	[14:27:17] Nope
2018-02-19 17:32:49	vktec	[14:27:35] That outputs the captured value rather than matching it
2018-02-19 17:32:49	RhodiumToad	[14:28:38] look at re.lua, for the equalcap function
2018-02-19 17:32:49	RhodiumToad	[14:29:10] =name is compiled as Cmt(Cb(name),equalcap)
2018-02-19 17:32:49	RhodiumToad	[14:30:08] so the Cb fetches the expected string, and equalcap compares it to the current text and returns either the end of the match or nil
2018-02-19 17:32:49	vktec	[14:35:02] RhodiumToad: Thanks, that looks like it'll work
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AbsoluteVirture	[15:37:26] hi there i am trying to compile c module for lua and i heard that we should never link the liblua during the compilation process cause it will clash with the interpreter
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AbsoluteVirture	[15:38:09] but a command like this cant find the meaning of all my lua functions: g++ luamodule.cpp -shared -o luamodule.so -fPIC
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AbsoluteVirture	[15:38:36] the linker errors: https://ideone.com/LDLure
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AbsoluteVirture	[15:39:58] but the thing i can't understand in the process of building c module of lua is on mac osx everything work like a charm without specifying anything related to liblua
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AbsoluteVirture	[15:40:16] g++ luamodule.cpp -bundle -undefined dynamic_lookup -o luamodule.so
2018-02-19 17:32:49	Habbie	[15:51:37] -undefined dynamic_lookup allows those symbols to be missing at this time
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AbsoluteVirture	[15:54:06] Habbie: ah ok, so this is something related to mac osx, didnt know we could ship a library with missing symbol
2018-02-19 17:32:49	Habbie	[15:54:42] as long as it's there at run time
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AbsoluteVirture	[15:54:50] Habbie: but for a linux/bsd user the line g++ luamodule.cpp -shared -o luamodule.so -fPIC should works too ?
2018-02-19 17:32:49	Habbie	[15:55:13] i understand from a quick google that the apple linker is 'different' in this regard, yes
2018-02-19 17:32:49	RhodiumToad	[15:55:51] why do people get so confused about the order of arguments to programs?
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AbsoluteVirture	[15:55:52] Habbie: damn i often try to mimic all my linux toolchain on mac osx but i reach my limit now
2018-02-19 17:32:49	Habbie	[15:56:05] AbsoluteVirture, 'use libtool'
2018-02-19 17:32:49	RhodiumToad	[15:56:15] g++ -shared -fPIC luamodule.cpp -o luamodule.so
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AbsoluteVirture	[15:56:52] RhodiumToad: yeah sorry i tried some random flags this is why -fPIC was at the end
2018-02-19 17:32:49	RhodiumToad	[15:56:52] though the -o luamodule.so can also go before the luamodule.cpp
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AbsoluteVirture	[15:57:33] Habbie: yeah i read it about it on http://lua-users.org/wiki/BuildingModules but never use this yet
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AbsoluteVirture	[16:14:32] how would you compile a c module for lua on a nix plateform ?
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AbsoluteVirture	[16:14:42] what do you use and command do you type ?
2018-02-19 17:32:49	furq	[16:14:51] 15:56:15 ( RhodiumToad) g++ -shared -fPIC luamodule.cpp -o luamodule.so
2018-02-19 17:32:49	furq	[16:14:52] that
2018-02-19 17:32:49	zash	[16:15:30] cc -shared -o blah.so blah.c
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AbsoluteVirture	[16:15:41] fand nothing wrong about with the linker on all these lua functions missing ?
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AbsoluteVirture	[16:16:21] like lua_pushnumber or luaL_newlib ?
2018-02-19 17:32:49	RhodiumToad	[16:17:27] is it actually giving you errors for them?
2018-02-19 17:32:49	furq	[16:17:47] i take it you're using extern "C"
2018-02-19 17:32:49	RhodiumToad	[16:17:58] functions like that should show up as external reference symbols in the resulting .so
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AbsoluteVirture	[16:18:41] ok ok (yeah sorry this is related to compiler, more than lua, was just curious) 
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AbsoluteVirture	[16:26:38] thx all for you help, now i am forced to admit that mac os x need different command/flags for compilation/linkage
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AbsoluteVirture	[16:29:35] between, i choose to use lua cause i need to fill and std::map in my C++ app with values taken from a lua table. As far as i discover lua i see i could do it manually.
2018-02-19 17:32:49	 *	RhodiumToad [16:30:31] didn't understand that statement
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AbsoluteVirture	[16:31:20] RhodiumToad: yeah sorry my english is pretty bad, and even worst my knowledge of lua is pretty low 
2018-02-19 17:32:49	AbsoluteVirture	[16:32:24] could you advice me for  good bridge/wrapper or libraries between lua and c++

2018-02-19 17:33:16	RhodiumToad	do you need to cope with metatables?

2018-02-19 17:33:53	AbsoluteVirture	so i think i dont need
2018-02-19 17:34:46	RhodiumToad	metatables change the behavior of objects, so a table with a metatable might behave as if it has different data in it than the raw table really contains
2018-02-19 17:35:28	AbsoluteVirture	RhodiumToad: the lua table looks something like this {background = "land.png", hero = "hero.png"} just want to pass this to my ressourcemanager in c++ this way he can load the ressource on his side

2018-02-20 19:50:10	Naergon	Do lua libraries work with luajit seamlesly? Or it is more like a separate language?
2018-02-20 19:50:33	rubenwardy	depends
2018-02-20 19:50:49	jdarnley	LuaJIT can be used as a drop in replacement for Lua 5.1
2018-02-20 19:50:50	rubenwardy	if they use only Lua 5.1 features, then usually yes
2018-02-20 19:50:52	RhodiumToad	libraries written for lua 5.1 should work with luajit without issues
2018-02-20 19:51:06	alkino	5.1 is equivalent for luajit
2018-02-20 19:51:06	furq	luajit 5.1 libraries work drop-in replace seamless ment
2018-02-20 19:51:11	furq	yes
2018-02-20 19:51:19	zash	including C libs
2018-02-20 19:51:53	Naergon	Thanks

2018-02-20 19:55:53	Naergon	And just some general info about language: is it almost instant build for lua and luajit(for repl of a large projects)? Does it support usual C-style wrap around arithmetics for int32?
2018-02-20 19:56:43	LordRyan	By "build" do you mean building the language from source?
2018-02-20 19:57:34	furq	lua 5.1 doesn't have any number wraparound at all
2018-02-20 19:57:36	furq	all numbers are doubles
2018-02-20 19:58:04	Naergon	I mean time till the first line of code is launched, for a code that is just received from a file/tcp
2018-02-20 19:58:10	zash	or whatever you set it to in luaconf.h or whatever it is
2018-02-20 19:58:29	zash	u wot
2018-02-20 19:58:32	furq	also int32 overflow is undefined
2018-02-20 19:58:38	LordRyan	Oh so you mean VM startup time?
2018-02-20 19:59:00	zash	Even plain Lua 5.1 runs circles around Python
2018-02-20 19:59:02	Naergon	No, time when WM is started on another code, then receives more code, and has to continue with this new code
2018-02-20 19:59:19	Naergon	VM*
2018-02-20 19:59:27	zash	wat
2018-02-20 19:59:47	LordRyan	it precompiles the bytecode and loads it into memory
2018-02-20 19:59:56	Naergon	Does lua has eval like in javascript to launch new code without VM reload?
2018-02-20 20:00:06	Habbie	yes
2018-02-20 20:01:22	LordRyan	% time = os.clock() load("print('Hello World!')")() print(os.clock() - time)
2018-02-20 20:01:22	yalb	LordRyan: Hello World!; 8.4999999999995e-05
2018-02-20 20:01:35	LordRyan	okay so it's about 0.00008 seconds to load and run that code
2018-02-20 20:01:38	Naergon	okay, so when we launch VM, launch some code, this code looks for more code from a file, (build time?), then launvhes this new code into the same VM. What is an expected pause in a (build time) approx? 
2018-02-20 20:01:46	Naergon	Hmmm, i aee
2018-02-20 20:01:57	Naergon	See*. Thats interesting
2018-02-20 20:02:02	LordRyan	It's fairly fast.
2018-02-20 20:02:25	LordRyan	Also if you use the require() function for loading libraries, the libraries will be cached in memory
2018-02-20 20:02:27	LordRyan	%? require
2018-02-20 20:02:28	yalb	LordRyan: http://lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#pdf-require
2018-02-20 20:02:30	Naergon	I just wanted to ensure, because its sexonds for other languages
2018-02-20 20:02:47	Naergon	seconds*
2018-02-20 20:03:21	rubenwardy	Lua is interpreted, not built
2018-02-20 20:03:28	rubenwardy	the other languages will likely be compiled
2018-02-20 20:03:31	rubenwardy	or more complex
2018-02-20 20:03:54	zash	Lua is compiled to bytecode
2018-02-20 20:04:01	Naergon	Right, i just wanted to be sure
2018-02-20 20:04:09	LordRyan	rubenwardy: no, it's compiled to a bytecode, which is barely different than how a machine does it
2018-02-20 20:04:30	rubenwardy	I've written an interpreter, I'm aware
2018-02-20 20:06:51	Naergon	And with recent rise of webassembly that can launch lua, lua might work in place of javascript, am i right? (can luajit do this to?)
2018-02-20 20:08:04	LordRyan	https://fengari.io
2018-02-20 20:08:23	LordRyan	Don't need webassembly, there's a port of the Lua 5.3 VM to JavaScript

2018-02-20 21:11:45	StephenLynx	1: its a waste of time, in the end it is running js anyway and you can't do anything you couldn't do before
2018-02-20 21:11:57	StephenLynx	2: it adds a layer of complexity, increasing the failure surface

2018-02-20 21:13:03	StephenLynx	if the code is not hard to understand, it doesn't matter how much one think its beautiful or elegant, thats a moot point.
2018-02-20 21:13:08	StephenLynx	this is not a pageant contest.
2018-02-20 21:13:32	StephenLynx	IMO, js looks better than lua.
2018-02-20 21:13:45	StephenLynx	but how can we measure this aspect? its a completely subjective point.
2018-02-20 21:14:08	mbalmer	beauty is in the eye of the beholder...

2018-02-23 00:14:23	zy]x[yz	[21:03:44] can you play gameboy games on the gba?
2018-02-23 00:14:23	N64N64	[21:03:48] yea
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[21:03:48] yeah
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[21:03:50] but not on a ds
2018-02-23 00:14:23	zy]x[yz	[21:03:51] woooaaah
2018-02-23 00:14:23	zy]x[yz	[21:03:56] I never knew that
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[21:04:10] the gba sp is frontlit though
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[21:04:18] you really need to do a backlight mod for it to not suck
2018-02-23 00:14:23	N64N64	[21:04:24] i like the frontlight
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[21:04:26] or use a gb micro but that's too small tbh
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[21:04:41] actually does the gb micro still have the gb game compatibility
2018-02-23 00:14:23	N64N64	[21:04:45] no
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[21:04:48] rip
2018-02-23 00:14:23	N64N64	[21:05:05] you can get an everdrive X5 and use the goomba emulator on it tho
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[21:05:17] yeah but you could also just use an emulator
2018-02-23 00:14:23	N64N64	[21:05:37] i dont like playing gameboy games on PC 
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[21:06:45] also the gba sp has no headphone jack
2018-02-23 00:14:23	zy]x[yz	[21:06:45] what if I play it with a controller on my pc that's connected to the tv
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[21:06:47] you need a separate dongle
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[21:07:15] and also the dongle plugs into the ac adapter port
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[21:07:27] does this sound familiar
2018-02-23 00:14:23	N64N64	[21:07:29] wut
2018-02-23 00:14:23	N64N64	[21:07:58] damn they were ahead of their time
2018-02-23 00:14:23	N64N64	[21:08:19] so much courage
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[21:08:35] actually i forgot they rereleased the gbasp with a backlight
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[21:09:00] i bet you'd need a new battery for it though
2018-02-23 00:14:23	N64N64	[21:11:00] why would they do that
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[21:11:12] because the frontlight is shit
2018-02-23 00:14:23	N64N64	[21:11:24] the frontlight is amazing
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[21:11:52] you are the only person in the world who thinks this
2018-02-23 00:14:23	N64N64	[21:11:56] for 3d games i agree frontlight is shit
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[21:11:58] either that or you actually have the backlit one and haven't realised
2018-02-23 00:14:23	N64N64	[21:12:14] frontlight is hella easy on the eyes
2018-02-23 00:14:23	N64N64	[21:13:19] and you can use the gameboy as a flashlight
2018-02-23 00:14:23	[xyzzy]	[21:37:37] im probably the only person in the world who can actually see a gba screen without a backlight. but i still can't see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch

2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[22:01:27] looking good q66 
2018-02-23 00:14:23	rjek	[22:30:41] Just spent an hour replacing the mech in my 18-year-old Meridian CD player.  Now I know why it was so expensive: half its weight is in screws, nuts, and washers.
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[22:32:33] lol a cd player
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[22:32:35] all right granddad
2018-02-23 00:14:23	rjek	[22:32:45] I've not used it in years
2018-02-23 00:14:23	rjek	[22:32:53] But it was so bloody expensive I want it to bloody work
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[22:33:23] i hope you're repairing it so you can sell it to some other idiot
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[22:33:45] while you graduate to the exciting brave new frontier of audiophilia which is arguing about whether wav sounds better than aiff
2018-02-23 00:14:23	rjek	[22:33:45] furq: Essentially.
2018-02-23 00:14:23	rjek	[22:34:02] Also it uses a PATA DVD-ROM drive, but the fucking thing isn't standard 5.25" mounting
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[22:34:18] and then getting extremely angry at anyone who shows up in the thread and says they're the same
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[22:34:25] this is NOT THE FORUM FOR THAT
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[22:35:10] are you going to get that ridiculous sony digital player that techmoan has
2018-02-23 00:14:23	furq	[22:35:15] the one that costs fucking £700 or something

2018-02-23 05:32:13	ttmrichter	elz: That would very much depend on precisely how that rgb value is encoded.
2018-02-23 05:32:25	ttmrichter	You said "array", so I assume it's returned as an array-flavoured table?
2018-02-23 05:32:37	ttmrichter	If so, you'd use the keys 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.

2018-02-23 05:33:21	ttmrichter	So if the encoding was { Red, Green, Blue, Alpha }, say, to get the red component it would be my_colour_value[1].

2018-02-24 22:45:51	zash	[14:51:40] I don't know what I want
2018-02-24 22:45:51	zash	[14:52:04] More tests, without me writing tests, probably.
2018-02-24 22:45:51	zash	[14:55:37] And a lightweight socket and TLS libraries that don't force some specific way of doing things on you
2018-02-24 22:45:51	zash	[14:58:12] Latest LuaSocket release being 3.0-rc1 from 2013 is ... interesting
2018-02-24 22:45:51	ttmrichter	[15:12:04] LuaSocket is pretty much moribund, yes.
2018-02-24 22:45:51	ttmrichter	[15:12:37] I managed to hack enough changes into it to get it working kinda/sorta in Windows with Lua 5.3, but ... yeah, not a fun experience.
2018-02-24 22:45:51	Tricycle	[15:19:27] I compiled LuaSocket for Lua 5.3 too
2018-02-24 22:45:51	LordRyan	[15:43:49] zash: I think busted is at a state now where it doesn't need anything more. I've never had problems using it, at least
2018-02-24 22:45:51	zash	[15:47:12] Someone mentioned async tests, which seems to be one of the remaining release blockers
2018-02-24 22:45:51	zash	[15:48:11] Not entirely sure we really need that tho, but some of the network related things might be eaiser
2018-02-24 22:45:51	LordRyan	[15:49:28] Async is extremely dependent on framework though unless you just thread the entire thing, which is technically an option
2018-02-24 22:45:51	LordRyan	[15:52:09] It looks like there's an async() to dispatch a worker, I assume by forking, and done() which probably reports back to busted the result
2018-02-24 22:45:51	BCB	[17:27:32] Humbedooh: where you at?
2018-02-24 22:45:51	madduck	[20:11:35] what am I doing wrong with string.format("%s %d", table.unpack(mytable)) ?
2018-02-24 22:45:51	madduck	[20:12:05] or rather, how do I pass an array to a variable arguments fucntion such as format?
2018-02-24 22:45:51	zash	[20:12:20] madduck: that should be how
2018-02-24 22:45:51	madduck	[20:12:53] I get "bad argument #2 to 'format' (no value)"
2018-02-24 22:45:51	madduck	[20:13:14] and yes, mytable is a table ;) 
2018-02-24 22:45:51	zash	[20:13:19] What's mytable[2]
2018-02-24 22:45:51	madduck	[20:13:48] {foo="bar"}
2018-02-24 22:45:51	ArRay_	[20:14:23] % string.format("%s %d", table.unpack({"test", 15}))
2018-02-24 22:45:51	yalb	[20:14:23] ArRay_: "test 15"
2018-02-24 22:45:51	madduck	[20:14:50] % string.format("%s %d", table.unpack({{foo="test"}, 15}))
2018-02-24 22:45:51	yalb	[20:14:51] madduck: "table: 0xb7f5e0 15"
2018-02-24 22:45:51	[xyzzy]	[20:14:58] are you sure you don't have a pair of parentheses around table.unpack
2018-02-24 22:45:51	ArRay_	[20:15:40] table.unpack doesn't unpack string keys
2018-02-24 22:45:51	madduck	[20:16:52] i think the problem must be elsewhere. http://scratch.madduck.net/2018-02-25-091641-paste-fqVEqx.txt
2018-02-24 22:45:51	[xyzzy]	[20:18:27] how are you calling dprintf
2018-02-24 22:45:51	[xyzzy]	[20:18:40] because `ipairs(...)` is a red flag
2018-02-24 22:45:51	madduck	[20:18:45] I don't think for i,arg in ipairs(…) do does what I expect
2018-02-24 22:45:51	madduck	[20:19:30] dprintf("foo %s %s", {foo={},baz=2}, "bar")
2018-02-24 22:45:51	[xyzzy]	[20:20:15] yeah that's no good
2018-02-24 22:45:51	[xyzzy]	[20:20:31] local args = table.pack(...)
2018-02-24 22:45:51	[xyzzy]	[20:20:38] ipairs(args)
2018-02-24 22:45:51	madduck	[20:20:41] tbl=table.pack(…)
2018-02-24 22:45:51	madduck	[20:20:44] right.
2018-02-24 22:45:51	[xyzzy]	[20:21:25] and then change the arg pushing to in-place modify or copy to a new table or w/e 
2018-02-24 22:45:51	ArRay_	[20:22:09] ipairs{...}
2018-02-24 22:45:51	ArRay_	[20:22:26] that should work too
2018-02-24 22:45:51	madduck	[20:22:30] ArRay_: no, that does not work
2018-02-24 22:45:51	madduck	[20:22:38] ipairs({…}) might
2018-02-24 22:45:51	ArRay_	[20:23:30] madduck: it does
2018-02-24 22:45:51	ArRay_	[20:23:49] % for i,v in ipairs{1,3,5} do print(i,v) end
2018-02-24 22:45:51	yalb	[20:23:49] ArRay_: 1 1; 2 3; 3 5
2018-02-24 22:45:51	ArRay_	[20:24:06] and you used the unicode character “…”
2018-02-24 22:45:51	ArRay_	[20:24:10] but you need to use three dots
2018-02-24 22:45:51	madduck	[20:24:16] that's just my irc client ;) 
2018-02-24 22:45:51	ArRay_	[20:24:48] (this lag is annoying)
2018-02-24 22:45:51	ArRay_	[20:25:12] ok
2018-02-24 22:45:51	 *	ArRay_ [20:25:37] has “…” on his keyboard

2018-02-25 02:33:33	AbsoluteVirtue	little question about scope in lua: http://codepad.org/lknFlFQB in this code the variable i is local to the function ? so i suppose variables created in a for statement (often for indexes) are local to the for loop ?
2018-02-25 02:34:07	RhodiumToad	yes
2018-02-25 02:34:38	AbsoluteVirtue	RhodiumToad: ok so after the "end" of the for loop variable i doesnt exist anymore

2018-02-25 02:34:59	RhodiumToad	yes, the loop variable itself is explicitly local to the loop

2018-02-25 02:36:01	RhodiumToad	one fine point is that the scope of a repeat until extends to the end of the until condition

2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[02:38:34] RhodiumToad: the host has to know i think
2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[02:38:43] he is the exception handler actually
2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[02:40:37] well if these c++ code is written as a lua module/library i think lua has to handle it anyway
2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[02:41:34] the outter C++ doesnt need to know what is happening exactly in the inner scope
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:41:52] ok, so what you can do is to catch any such exceptions in the inner c++ code and turn them into lua errors
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:42:17] I'm not using c++, but I have a similar thing going with postgresql errors
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:42:58] so for example lua code can do   rc,err = pcall(function() spi.execute("some sql statement") end)
2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[02:42:59] RhodiumToad: ahaha, actually i am thinking about something dirty, let say i have a core c++ function draw
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:43:24] and if there's an sql error, the value of "err" will be a userdata object that the lua code can inspect with various methods
2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[02:44:24] this function throw. I can add a flag.. am i called from lua or am i called from c++, if from c++ i throw, else i use lua error
2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[02:44:34] but this is really bad i think
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:44:53] not so bad
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:46:50] I guess the question is how much information do you need to convey in the error
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:47:25] in my case there's a lot, because in addition to a descriptive string the SQL errors have an sqlstate code and various diagnostic fields
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:47:57] if all your errors just amount to string messages, then that's easier
2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[02:48:16] actually i am working with string only
2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[02:48:26] but it is really experimantal
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:49:25] another thing I do that you might want to consider is:
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:49:47] I have a variable that keeps track of whether the innermost error handling context is from lua or from postgresql
2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[02:51:28] RhodiumToad: how does it work ?
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:52:06] er, I just set it accordingly
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:53:17] so when doing lua_pcall from C code, I do   oldctx = pllua_context; pllua_context = PLLUA_CONTEXT_LUA; lua_pcall(...); pllua_context = oldctx;
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:53:29] though this is wrapped in some function calls for clarity
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:53:49] and when I need to call postgresql code that might error, I have
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:54:17] oldctx = pllua_context; pllua_context = PLLUA_CONTEXT_PG; PG_TRY(); { ... } PG_CATCH(); { ... }
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:54:31] and the code in the catch block or after the catch restores the context
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:54:42] (this is all wrapped up in macros for clarity)
2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[02:55:46] ok nice trick
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:56:06] I wouldn't necessarily do it the same way in c++
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:56:39] c++ with lua built to use throw/catch has one major advantage: you can call lua_* functions that might throw, and handle errors in a catch block
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:56:55] in C I can't do that, which complicates the code substantially
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:57:19] any time I'm in a PG_TRY/PG_CATCH I have to be absolutely sure that I don't call any Lua api function that might throw error
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[02:58:17] (which is how I discovered the bug in 5.3.3/5.3.4 where lua_pushcfunction can throw an error even though it's documented not to)
2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[03:00:52] RhodiumToad: just for confirmation.. a lua_dofile throw or not ? caus ein the doc it is tagged as [-0, +?, e]
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[03:01:10] what lua version are you using?
2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[03:01:52] the last one 5.3.4
2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[03:02:03] last stable one i think
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[03:02:14] so luaL_dofile is literally defined as ((luaL_loadfile(L, fn) || lua_pcall(L, 0, LUA_MULTRET, 0))
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[03:03:18] luaL_loadfile can throw memory-related errors only (that's either "out of memory" or an error thrown from a finalizer in the garbage collector)
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[03:03:27] lua_pcall throws no error
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[03:03:52] so the correct tag in the doc should be [-0, +?, m]  I think
2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[03:03:59] yeah i think too
2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[03:04:22] unless it is not implemented as the doc said
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[03:05:03] it definitely is implemented that way, I'm reading the source not the doc
2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[03:05:18] ah ok :)
2018-02-27 09:14:27	RhodiumToad	[03:06:59] luaL_loadfile has some lua_pushstring/lua_pushliteral calls in it, which is why it can throw
2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[03:08:06] ok
2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[03:10:32] RhodiumToad: really interesting to talk with you, and thx for the help again.. i will have to pay you a beer one day if i see you :)
2018-02-27 09:14:27	AbsoluteVirtue	[03:10:49] but it is 4 am here, i have to sleep a bit >.>

2018-02-27 10:48:00	Guest25682	Hello everyone, is it possible to print escape sequences on the console when they are used as indices in a table without them being interpreted?

2018-02-27 10:49:12	Guest25682	I tried `string.format("%q", k)` and `"\\" .. k .. " : " .. v` but neither of them works.
2018-02-27 10:52:05	Habbie	%q works for me
2018-02-27 10:54:03	Guest25682	This is what I get with %q: http://codepad.org/oPF6oPUf

2018-02-27 10:54:56	Habbie	on my lua 5.3
2018-02-27 10:55:09	Habbie	on 5.1 i agree with you, yes
2018-02-27 10:59:40	Guest25682	On 5.3, newline is broken.
2018-02-27 11:00:29	Guest25682	Also, there's no way to get `"\a"` instead of `"\7"` for example?
2018-02-27 11:02:26	Habbie	well, newline is printable
2018-02-27 11:02:28	Habbie	so it's printed
2018-02-27 11:02:36	Habbie	i'm not aware of anything that can map characters back to \a
2018-02-27 11:03:19	Guest25682	OK, that's what I was wondering, thank you very much for you time Habbie!

2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[03:16:06] is me again
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[03:16:17] I'm trying to find a way to solve a little problem I'm running into.
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[03:17:15] when calling a function, i need to apply some variables to it, sometimes more, sometimes less, how can I set a function for, when not receiving a certain attribute, just assign it a standard value?
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[03:17:50] like, python for example, I can create a function fun(attrA, attrB = 0):
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[03:18:09] and If I don't assing a value for attrB when calling it, he just get's zeero
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[03:18:14] how can I do that in lua?
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[03:18:19] is it supported?
2018-03-10 17:39:49	RhodiumToad	[03:18:19] lua doesn't have default args, you can check for nil though

2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[03:20:01] ok...
2018-03-10 17:39:49	RhodiumToad	[03:20:08] note, that assumes you don't want to pass the value "false" for b
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[03:20:26] so, when calling the function I can just ignore the extra attributes (if a treat them inside the function)?
2018-03-10 17:39:49	RhodiumToad	[03:20:58] if you pass fewer values to a function than it expects, then the unspecified ones have the value nil
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[03:21:05] ok
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[03:21:07] ok
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[03:21:34] i hear it... well, that create a lot of extra code for treatment, but ok.
2018-03-10 17:39:49	RhodiumToad	[03:21:34] if b might be false, you could use   if b == nil then b = 0 end
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[03:21:36] acceptable
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[03:42:10] ok ok. got it. let me try that... this is actually kind of fun to try hahaha
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[03:42:21] I'm connecting zenity to lua with a set of functions
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[03:42:30] will make my live waaaaaaaaay easier in the future
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[04:32:08] hey guys
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[04:32:19] what is the oposite of require('x')?
2018-03-10 17:39:49	RhodiumToad	[04:32:29] opposite?
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[04:32:30] is there a dump('x') or reload('x')?
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[04:32:58] or if I just re-require the same file he will load again and overwrite the old one?
2018-03-10 17:39:49	RhodiumToad	[04:33:10] re-requiring the file won't reload it
2018-03-10 17:39:49	RhodiumToad	[04:33:30] require stores whatever it loaded in package.loaded, and if you require it again it just gets the value from there
2018-03-10 17:39:49	RhodiumToad	[04:33:52] you could clobber the value in that table to make it load it again
2018-03-10 17:39:49	RhodiumToad	[04:34:11] however, that may not do what you want when it comes to modules that have C codee
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[04:34:12] ok. it's because I'm testing a bunch of functions and even if I save the fixed file the lua interpreter will still get it from memory not from the file
2018-03-10 17:39:49	RhodiumToad	[04:34:13] *code
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[04:34:18] +... RhodiumToad I promisse I will stop with those crazy questions in a bit hahaha.
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[04:35:22] its pure lua...
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[04:35:50] i'm just testing the modifications I'm making in one file, and at the moment I'm getting out and in again of the lua interpreter
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[04:35:57] and reloading the lua file again
2018-03-10 17:39:49	rungcc	[04:36:03] it's getting kind of annoying

2018-03-10 18:14:00	rungcc	[03:16:04] hi guys
2018-03-10 18:14:00	rungcc	[03:16:06] is me again
2018-03-10 18:14:00	rungcc	[03:16:17] I'm trying to find a way to solve a little problem I'm running into.
2018-03-10 18:14:00	rungcc	[03:17:15] when calling a function, i need to apply some variables to it, sometimes more, sometimes less, how can I set a function for, when not receiving a certain attribute, just assign it a standard value?
2018-03-10 18:14:00	rungcc	[03:17:50] like, python for example, I can create a function fun(attrA, attrB = 0):
2018-03-10 18:14:00	rungcc	[03:18:09] and If I don't assing a value for attrB when calling it, he just get's zeero
2018-03-10 18:14:00	rungcc	[03:18:14] how can I do that in lua?
2018-03-10 18:14:00	rungcc	[03:18:19] is it supported?
2018-03-10 18:14:00	RhodiumToad	[03:18:19] lua doesn't have default args, you can check for nil though
2018-03-10 18:14:00	RhodiumToad	[03:19:22] function foo(a,b) b = b or 0 print(a,b) end
2018-03-10 18:14:00	RhodiumToad	[03:19:41] % function foo(a,b) b = b or 0 print(a,b) end  foo(123)
2018-03-10 18:14:00	yalb	[03:19:41] RhodiumToad: 123 0
2018-03-10 18:14:00	RhodiumToad	[03:19:52] % function foo(a,b) b = b or 0 print(a,b) end  foo(123,1)
2018-03-10 18:14:00	yalb	[03:19:52] RhodiumToad: 123 1
2018-03-10 18:14:00	rungcc	[03:20:01] ok...
2018-03-10 18:14:00	RhodiumToad	[03:20:08] note, that assumes you don't want to pass the value "false" for b

2018-03-10 18:14:00	rungcc	[03:21:36] acceptable

2018-03-11 18:33:07	furq	that's more complicated because you don't know how many lines are in the file

2018-03-11 18:37:55	furq	no
2018-03-11 18:39:07	zy]x[yz	you can open it for reading, unlink it, then open a new file with the original name for writing.  but that's neither portable nor possible without either a third party lib or getting into c
2018-03-11 18:39:11	furq	right
2018-03-11 18:39:23	furq	if you're adding stuff at the end of a file then you don't need a temp file

2018-03-11 21:38:00	FrankyCyborg	i have the problem of compiling LuaJIT on my Mac OS X 10.5.8 PowerPC machine. the build process stops after some files, trying to compile the file   src/lj_vm.s   , with multiple errors like:   buildvm_ppc.dasc:<LINE NUMBER>:Invalid mnemonic 'plt'  .  I am not aware of any mnemonic 'plt' for PowerPC and doing a   grep -R plt    over the source tree shows me, that the file src/host/buildvm.c has a comment about '@plt' inside a preprocesso
2018-03-11 21:38:01	FrankyCyborg	block, indicating that something has been removed, related to PowerPC stuff..  so, it's more likely about a missing symbol, named 'plt'.
2018-03-11 21:38:12	FrankyCyborg	vey funny, i'm still trying to conduct my research...
2018-03-11 21:38:15	FrankyCyborg	=)

2018-03-11 23:39:34	luxio	Is there a way to kill the coroutine inside of coroutine.wrap?
2018-03-11 23:39:51	luxio	like "break"?
2018-03-11 23:41:25	LordRyan	luxio: just stop calling it?
2018-03-11 23:41:43	luxio	no I mean inside the coroutine
2018-03-11 23:41:49	LordRyan	you get out of a coroutine using coroutine.yield() which acts as "returning" from the function returned by coroutine.wrap()

2018-03-11 23:53:33	pdk`	doesn't returning from the function you're using as a coroutine effectively do that
2018-03-11 23:54:52	furq	yes
2018-03-11 23:55:35	pdk`	once the function you used as a coroutine returns then it's "dead"
2018-03-11 23:55:59	furq	i assume he wants something you can call from a nested function
2018-03-11 23:56:48	[xyzzy]	coroutine wraps are delicious
2018-03-11 23:57:06	pdk`	yeah, the best you can do there is yield() from the nested function and have it yield some sort of sentinel value
2018-03-11 23:57:15	pdk`	then going up the call chain you'd check for that sentinel value to tell whether you should bail out early

2018-03-11 23:59:21	pdk`	since you can yield() multiple values at once you could have the first value you yield be an indicator for "should i bail early? y/n" and the remaining values are whatever you actually wanted to pass back

2018-03-12 01:12:45	luxio	I have two files, A and B, where B is required by A. I want B to have access to variables on file A, but I don't want to have to pass those variables each time a function of file B is called. How can I do this?
2018-03-12 01:17:10	LordRyan	when you need access to something inside A ,use require("whatever you'd use to load A")
2018-03-12 01:17:27	LordRyan	it'll use a cached version of the library as long as package.loaded I think it is hasn't changed
2018-03-12 01:17:37	luxio	variables inside A are constantly changing though
2018-03-12 01:18:09	LordRyan	then use a table and store the values in a table; the table won't change but the variables will
2018-03-12 01:18:34	LordRyan	well actually, no, just having them as values in the table returned from A is fine either way.
2018-03-12 01:19:51	luxio	so if file A returns table {["123"] = 123.0}, then B does require("A.lua"), then 5 seconds later A changes ["123"] to 124.0, will B know that it was updated, or will 123.0 be the cached value?
