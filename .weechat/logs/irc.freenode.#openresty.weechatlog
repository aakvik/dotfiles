2018-02-07 17:21:00	sobel	i'm still contemplating a change to the postgresql json encoder. json types get escaped as strings instead of embedded as json.

2018-02-10 22:24:24	sobel	sorta ironic that the json type works poorest with ngx_rds but i understand how it got that way
2018-02-10 22:25:25	sobel	oh balls, i bet it's ngx_rds that does the quoting and it probably doesn't have type info
2018-02-10 22:34:03	sobel	found it. https://github.com/openresty/rds-json-nginx-module/blob/master/src/ngx_http_rds_json_output.c#L422

2018-02-11 13:59:02	sobel	then there's a piece in the dbd-to-json encoder that actually does the encoding, which would need the type info. so ugh. no facility i can piggyback on for this.
2018-02-11 13:59:55	sobel	now taking architecture advice. the dbd-json module doesn't have to (currently) know much about modules that output dbd, it just blindly encodes them

2018-03-10 17:39:49	iNthrAX	[14:36:11] Hi!
2018-03-10 17:39:49	iNthrAX	[14:37:08] Have a question: is there something like channels (in golang) for communication between coroutines?
2018-03-10 17:39:49	iNthrAX	[14:37:50] I've been developing in lua on another plafrom
2018-03-10 17:39:49	iNthrAX	[14:38:49] and there are fibers (as coroutines) and channels, that allow to suspend coroutine in waiting for given event from another
2018-03-10 17:39:49	ryan_ford	[16:15:41] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12889361/lua-sockets-asynchronous-events
2018-03-10 17:39:49	ryan_ford	[16:15:52] does that help at all?
2018-03-10 17:39:49	iNthrAX	[15:31:46] ryan_ford, I've read that and there is a clarification of how to use .select for waiting on socket. Or to use something else. But the question was not about async in general or in Lua at all, but in openresty
2018-03-10 17:39:49	iNthrAX	[15:33:38] consider I have such a case: I have 1 coroutine, that is responsible for network communication over multiplexed connection. and a have N coroutines, created by requests, that want to send request into that connection and wait for the response
