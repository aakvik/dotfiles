2017-09-23 00:45:12	rootcmdr	Hi Everyone!  I'm trying to figure out why Netfilter is dropping some packets that are being forwarded.  I've added log lines to my iptables rules and I can see the packet getting all the way to the mangle POSTROUTING chain, and they are somehow getting dropped before they reach the nat POSTROUTING chain(the first rule of this chain is LOG).  These packets represent the return path of a TCP connection.  The ingress path is different, so there aren't
2017-09-23 00:45:12	rootcmdr	 any connection tracking table entries.  I have rp_filter=0 on the interfaces these packets are traversing.
2017-09-23 00:45:48	rootcmdr	Do you all have any ideas what could be dropping these packets?

2017-09-24 01:06:13	@Jefe	You want to know the final result, or the C-level how it gets done?
2017-09-24 01:06:22	whoisxy	final result
2017-09-24 01:06:30	@Jefe	That's easy.
2017-09-24 01:07:04	@Jefe	It redirects the packet to the first IP assigned to the interface the packet was received on, perhaps changing the port.
2017-09-24 01:07:44	whoisxy	Jefe: so dest ip and dest port are lost
2017-09-24 01:07:56	@Jefe	dest port is not lost if it is not changed.
2017-09-24 01:08:03	whoisxy	but it it is
2017-09-24 01:08:07	whoisxy	*if it
2017-09-24 01:08:10	acidvegas	is incoming and outgoing traffic on the loopback (lo) required or just output
2017-09-24 01:08:13	@Jefe	Then, yes.
2017-09-24 01:08:37	@Jefe	acidvegas, you mean an ACCEPT rule?
2017-09-24 01:09:13	acidvegas	yeah
2017-09-24 01:09:23	acidvegas	i have
2017-09-24 01:09:23	acidvegas	iptables -A INPUT  -i lo -j ACCEPT
2017-09-24 01:09:23	acidvegas	iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
2017-09-24 01:09:28	acidvegas	right now but idk if BOTH are required
2017-09-24 01:10:08	whoisxy	Hmmm. redsocks which is program which recives network traffic and passes it through a proxy expects me to use the redirect but if it's replacing the IP and port then how will it know where I want the request to go?
2017-09-24 01:10:18	whoisxy	maybe that's a bit offtopic for here
2017-09-24 01:11:31	whoisxy	s/network traffic/TCP packets/ ... sorry for the lack of punctuation
2017-09-24 01:14:13	@Jefe	whoisxy, HTTP includes the destination in the layer 7 data.
2017-09-24 01:14:47	@Jefe	acidvegas, I would include both those rules if your policies on the INPUT and OUTPUT chains are DROP.

2017-09-24 01:16:06	whoisxy	Jefe: maybe my understanding is incorrect is socks specific to HTTP
2017-09-24 01:16:42	@Jefe	No, I don't think so.  But I assume the instructions you are reading are saying to REDIRECT port 80.
2017-09-24 01:17:21	whoisxy	I hope not I wanted to proxy TCP traffic
2017-09-24 01:17:35	@Jefe	Hmm, I'm not sure.
2017-09-24 01:18:27	whoisxy	this was there example root# iptables -t nat -A REDSOCKS -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 12345
2017-09-24 01:18:37	@Jefe	Actually, I don't think the dst addr is lost.  It just gets consumed locally.  Again, I could be wrong.
2017-09-24 01:19:55	@Jefe	You could always use TRACE to figure out what is happening.
2017-09-24 01:20:22	whoisxy	Jefe: I'm not using iptables, I use nftables
2017-09-24 01:21:16	@Jefe	Well I don't know.  Sorry.  Maybe one of the devs is around.
2017-09-24 01:21:28	acidvegas	Jefe: is --dports for INCOMMING or OUTGOING usage when using -m multiport
2017-09-24 01:22:04	@Jefe	It's short for --destination-port.
2017-09-24 01:22:19	@Jefe	s/\.$/s./
2017-09-24 01:23:35	@Jefe	Anyway, I gotta run.
2017-09-24 01:23:55	whoisxy	Jefe: okay thanks for your help anyway I'll see if I can get an understanding of the kernel functions that deal with redirecting the traffic some of the named aren't too clear but it doesn't look to big or complex

2017-09-24 18:04:53	@Thermi	tjis: no XFRm policy match, no hashlimit (?), no ipset support
2017-09-24 18:07:15	tjis	nft has its own set datastructures with many more features than ipset. agree on the xfrm though. what is hashlimit?
2017-09-24 18:08:48	@Thermi	I know that. The nft sets do not have the same or a superset of the functionality of ipsets. read the manual for iptables-extensions.
2017-09-24 18:09:24	@Thermi	e.g. almost atomic swapping, saving the rules without the sets, ...
2017-09-24 18:11:17	tjis	huh, nft operations should be atomic
2017-09-24 18:11:45	tjis	that's not very nice if they aren't :(
2017-09-24 18:11:53	@Thermi	no, the ipset swap isn't atomic
2017-09-24 18:11:58	@Thermi	AFAIK nft has no swapping
2017-09-24 18:12:26	tjis	nft -f filename should load and apply everything in a file in an atomic way
2017-09-24 18:12:44	@Thermi	I do not see how that applies to my argument
2017-09-24 18:13:25	tjis	well, if that file swaps out a set, that should be atomic
2017-09-24 18:13:39	@Thermi	Is there an operation that swaps sets like ipset does?
2017-09-24 18:14:10	tjis	there isn't, but nft scripts as a whole are applied atomically, rather than one command after another
2017-09-24 18:14:18	@Thermi	Well, then my point stands.
2017-09-24 18:14:26	tjis	so you flush the set and load a new one, but it's still atomic
